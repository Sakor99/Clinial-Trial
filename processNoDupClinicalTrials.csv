NCT01079481,Combination Anticancer Therapy of Paclitaxel and Everolimus for Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer,The objective of this phase I study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combination therapy of paclitaxel and everolimus in small cell lung cancer patient with previous treatment history.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all lung cancer, and more than half of these patients are diagnosed with extensive stage disease (ED). SCLC is a particularly aggressive form of lung cancer with a tendency for rapid tumor growth, early dissemination and high frequency of the metastasis In this study, we evaluate the MTD of everolimus combined with paclitaxel combination chemotherapy in SCLC.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Relapsed or Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer, Paclitaxel, Everolimus",18 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Small Cell Lung Cancer,taxol plus everolimus
NCT00807573,"Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed in Patients With Untreated, Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Using Web Based Data Collection, Patient Self Reporting of Adverse Effects and Automated Response Assessment","The purpose of this study is to determine the percentage of patients with non small cell lung cancer that will experience a shrinkage of their tumors following treatment with three medications given together: paclitaxel, pemetrexed (Alimta®), and bevacizumab (Avastin®). Each of these medications has been approved by the FDA for patients that have not received any treatment for their lung cancer. This study is designed to study the effects of all three drugs given at the same time. Each of these medications has been studied in lung cancer and is commercially available. Paclitaxel and pemetrexed are traditional chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody, which means that it attaches to a specific target. Bevacizumab attaches to a protein in the blood stream called Vascular Endothelial GrowthFactor (VEGF). VEGF helps tumors grow new blood vessels to feed themselves, and bevacizumab is thought to help block this new growth of blood vessels and starve the tumors of the nutrients they need.","In this clinical trial, we also will be studying other things. We want to learn more about how to manage side effects patients may develop during chemotherapy. Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such as nausea, pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may be due to the cancer itself, or due to treatments like chemotherapy drugs or radiation therapy. Doctors and nurses often ask patients about their symptoms, because an important part of cancer treatment is to make patients feel as well as possible. If patients do not feel well, we may need to change the way we are treating them or prescribe therapies that will decrease their symptoms. The best way to find out how the patient is feeling is to ask them directly. We are interested in developing new ways to ask patients about how they are feeling, using the Internet. A special new website called STAR (Symptom Tracking and Reporting for Patients) has been developed to help patients record this information, so that their doctors and nurses can review it during clinic appointments. This study is designed to help us see if STAR is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about patients\ symptoms and quality of life. As part of this study, a computerized (automated) technique of determining the size of the patients tumor(s) before and after treatment will be used. This has been tested in the past and found to be more accurate. The automated technique of determining tumor size will be used with the routine CT scans that the patient will have as part of the study. This automated method of measuring the tumor(s) will allow us to know sooner whether this drug treatment is causing the disease to shrink. The information from STAR and the automated tumor measurements are going to be placed on a very secure Internet site. This will provide the doctor with all of the information needed to determine if this drug combination is working for the patient and whether to continue this study. Also, if there is a tumor sample from a biopsy done in the past, it will be analyzed for a protein that may be present in the lung cancer.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"BEVACIZUMAB (AVASTIN), PEMETREXED (ALTIMA), TAXOL (PACLITAXEL), 08 109",2 years,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Lung Cancer,"Paclitaxel, Pemetrexed, Bevacizumab"

NCT02733250,Pembrolizumab With Nab Paclitaxel in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of nab paclitaxel to be safely administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced inoperable non small cell lung cancer. The study is also aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the combination therapy.,"This is a phase 1,2, open label, proof of concept study of nab paclitaxel administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Part 1 of the study will assess the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of nab paclitaxel in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg administered on day 1 of each 21 day cycle). Dose escalation for nab paclitaxel will be conducted according to the 3+3 design until the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Part 2 of the study will evaluate the administration of pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks in combination with nab paclitaxel at the RP2D. Determining the RP2D will classify the treatment combination as safe and allow for an expansion of the study population, which will ultimately lead to further assessments of safety and tolerability as well as an evaluation of the anti tumoral effect of the proposed treatment combination. Using Simon\s optimal 2 stage design for Phase II clinical trials, we determined that a sample size of 36 patients would be adequate to test the proposed hypothesis. The primary efficacy analysis of overall response rate (ORR) will be interpreted as follows: 1) if less than 9 partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) are recorded, the combination of nab paclitaxel and pembrolizumab provides less than additive effects and is not likely to be clinically superior compared to pembrolizumab alone based on an ORR assessment; 2) however, if 9 or more PR or CR are recorded, the treatment combination warrants further clinical study. This could take the form of an extended phase II (to reach the 97 patients calculated from the model) or a phase III study. Treatment will continue until disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1), unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator\s decision to withdraw the subject, investigator\s noncompliance with trial treatment or procedures requirements, the subject receives 24 months of uninterrupted treatment or 35 administrations of study medication (whichever is later), or administrative reasons.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"NSCLC, Pembrolizumab, Nab paclitaxel","Safety follow up will be maintained up to 90 days following the administration of the last study drug dose., up to 56 months",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Lung Cancer,"Pembrolizumab, Nab Paclitaxel"
NCT01171170,"Paclitaxel Carboplatin Bevacizumab +, Nitroglycerin in Metastatic Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","This study is designed to assess the effects of adding nitroglycerin (NTG) patches, delivery 25 mg NTG per 24 h, to the standard first line treatment of metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), i.e. 4 cycles of carboplatin paclitaxel bevacizumab, followed by bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Tumor hypoxia is a common phenomenon in lung cancer; it is a known poor prognostic marker, related to treatment resistance. Pre clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating drugs may decrease hypoxia related drug resistance. NTG is a NO donating drug. NTG increases tumor blood flow and thereby augments antitumor drug delivery to the tumor. A randomized phase II has shown an increase in the response rate from 42% to 72%, when NTG patches (25 mg,day, day 2 to +3) were added to vinorelbine,cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, the time to progression increased from 185 to 327 days. The hypothesis of the present study is that adding NTG transdermal patches to bevacizumab containing chemotherapy improves progression free survival, response rate and overall survival in patients with metastatic non squamous NSCLC.","Standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of platinum containing chemotherapy. It has been shown that the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy improves progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with non squamous NSCLC. There is a need for improved PFS and OS and response rates to chemotherapy are only 25 35%. Tumor hypoxia is a common phenomenon in lung cancer; it is a known poor prognostic marker, related to treatment resistance. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 1α is the major factor regulating the response to hypoxia. HIF directly activates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor. Bevacizumab interacts with this pathway by blocking VEGF. Pre clinical studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating drugs may decrease hypoxia related drug resistance. Nitroglycerin (NTG) is a NO donating drug. NTG increases tumor blood flow and thereby augments antitumor drug delivery to the tumor and inhibits HIF 1α. Interestingly, it has recently been shown in mouse models that the addition of HIF 1α inhibitors to bevacizumab significantly inhibits tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. A randomized phase II has shown an increase in the response rate from 42% to 72%, when NTG patches (25 mg,day, day 2 to +3) were added to vinorelbine,cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC.

NCT02730247,Clinical Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of the Addition of Ramucirumab to Nab paclitaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"The subjects who take part in this clinical research study have advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has been previously treated with other drugs. If they join this study, they would receive ramucirumab (Cyramza ®) in combination with nab paclitaxel (Abraxane®). Ramucirumab given with nab paclitaxel is considered an investigational drug combination to use in this type of cancer because giving these two drugs together has not been approved by any regulatory authority like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NSCLC cancer. Ramucirumab works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells. Nab Paclitaxel works by blocking the ability of cancer cells to break down the internal skeleton that allows them to divide and multiply. With the skeleton still in place, the cells cannot divide and they eventually die.","Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 (Immunoglobulin G) monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR 2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor). A recent double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluated the addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel compared with docetaxel and placebo in patients with Stage IV squamous and non squamous NSCLC in the 2nd line treatment setting. This study demonstrated a superior overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR) with the combination therapy compared with docetaxel with placebo. This effect was seen across histologic subtypes, in the absence of excess toxicity in patients with squamous cell histology. This finding is intriguing, as prior study of bevacizumab in patients with NSCLC of squamous cell histology was associated with excess pulmonary hemorrhage. This provides the rationale for further investigation of ramucirumab in patients with squamous cell NSCLC. nab Paclitaxel is a formulation of paclitaxel complexed with albumin that is readily soluble in saline and allows administration of paclitaxel without the use of lipid based solvents and the need for corticosteroid and antihistamine premedication. nab Paclitaxel was approved for the 1st line treatment of NSCLC based on a trial which demonstrated a superior ORR with the addition of nab paclitaxel to carboplatin compared with carboplatin,paclitaxel in patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC, as well as prolonged PFS and OS without statistical significance. The subgroup analysis by tumor histology demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for nab paclitaxel,carboplatin in terms of best overall response rate (41% vs 24%, p<0.001), and numerically better PFS and OS in squamous NSCLC. 3 This is a single arm phase II clinical trial, in which patients with previously treated NSCLC will be treated with ramucirumab,nab paclitaxel until disease progression, unacceptable treatment related toxicity or withdrawal of consent with the primary endpoint of progression free survival. A minimum of 40 patients with squamous cell histology will be required for determination of the co primary endpoint.

NCT00278148,"Erlotinib, Paclitaxel, and Carboplatin Combined With Radiation Therapy for Stage III Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving erlotinib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin together with radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

NCT00686322,Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) With Paclitaxel Plus Cisplatin in LA Non small cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"Present study is to investigate efficacy and toxicity profiles of induction one cycle of paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), concurrent 2 cycles of PC with radiotherapy, followed by 2 cycles of PC consolidation chemotherapy.","Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer death in Taiwan and throughout the world in both developed and developing countries. More than 75% of NSCLC patients are inoperable because of either distantly metastatic disease or disease confined to one hemithorax with one or more criteria of unresectability at the time of presentation. The prognosis of such inoperable metastatic patients is poor. The benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy for stage III disease of NSCLC is well established. The largest of the prospective trials was sponsored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), ECOG, and the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), and allocated 490 patients to receive 2 months of cisplatin + vinblastine chemotherapy followed by 60 Gy of radiation at 2 Gy per fraction; or one of two radiation alone arms. Overall survival was statistically superior for the patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation versus the other two arms of the study (13.2 months vs 12 months, vs 11.4 months, respectively; p=0.04). Administration of chemotherapy concurrently with radiation therapy theoretically improves local control by sensitizing the tumor to radiation, while simultaneously treating systemic disease, albeit at the expense of greater local toxicity. Two large phase III studies suggest improvement in both local control and survival with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as compared with sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation for patients with stage III NSCLC. Although rates of nonhematologic toxicity were higher on the concurrent arms, median survival time trended toward superiority in the concomitant chemotherapy plus daily radiation arm compared with the sequential arm. One source of debate is whether the addition of induction or consolidation chemotherapy adds anything to concomitant chemoradiotherapy, with numerous intergroup trials underway. CALGB has completed a randomized phase II study of two cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by two additional cycles of the same drugs with concomitant radiotherapy. The three treatment arms included four cycles of cisplatin (80 mg,m2) combined with either gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or vinorelbine. Radiotherapy was completed during the last two cycles to a total of 66 Gy. Response rates were similar, and median survival for all patients was 17 months with no clearly superior arm evident in this randomized phase II trial. We proposed this clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profile of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin in previously untreated, stage IIIa,IIIb NSCLC patients who received 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"chemotherapy, radiotherapy, lung cancer",one year,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non small cell Lung Cancer,Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (paclitaxel plus cisplatin plus radiotherapy)

The safety of this combination will also be evaluated.","Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States. Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is limited. The study will test two chemotherapy agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, in combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR. Rationale: The present study is built upon the data from previous studies, incorporating cetuximab into each of two regimens of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The results of prior studies using paclitaxel and carboplatin demonstrate that these drugs in combination, using a variety of schedules, are both safe and effective as therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti EGFR agent cetuximab to the combination will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB,IV NSCLC.

The safety and effectiveness of this drug combination will also be studied.,"Sorafenib is designed to stop the growth of cells that are caused by genetic changes often associated with cancer. Paclitaxel is designed to work by blocking the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells, which may cause them to die. Carboplatin is designed to work by interfering with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell division. Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the effects of a blood vessel stimulating agent that plays an important role in the growth of both normal and abnormal blood vessels. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 4 different drugs during the study. This study will follow a 3 week schedule known as a study cycle. In the first part of the study, researchers are trying to find out the highest dose of the study drugs that can be safely given together. The first group of 6 participants will receive lower doses of sorafenib and bevacizumab. The doses of paclitaxel and carboplatin will stay the same for up to 6 cycles for the study for all participants who complete 6 cycles. If the first 6 participants do not have intolerable side effects, the next group of patients will get higher doses of bevacizumab. The doses of sorafenib will be increased until at least some participants have unacceptable side effects. The dose that you get will not increase during the study, but if you have bad side effects, your dose of sorafenib, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, or carboplatin may be lowered at future visits. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will be given bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in your vein as an infusion. Paclitaxel will be infused over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes, followed by bevacizumab over 90 minutes for the first 2 cycles. Your bevacizumab infusion may be given over a shorter time period in later cycles. You will stay in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after your bevacizumab infusion for all cycles after 1 and 2. You will take sorafenib by mouth twice a day, once in the morning before 11:00 am and once in the evening before 11:00 p.m. Sorafenib should be taken with about 1 cup of water on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal) or with a moderate fat diet (about 30% of calories from fat). Sorafenib must be swallowed whole without chewing. On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2, your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will be asked questions to find out how the disease is progressing and how the disease affects the quality of life. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. If possible, you should not change your medications between Cycle 1 Day 1 until all procedures are completed on Cycle 2 Day 3. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will receive infusions of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab into a vein. On Cycle 1 Day 2, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. On Cycle 1 Day 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests. After your blood samples have been collected, you will be given your morning dose of sorafenib. You will be given sorafenib to take at home that night. On Cycle 2 Day 2, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Once your blood samples has been collected, your morning dose of sorafenib will be given to you in the clinic. You will be given sorafenib to take at home that night. On Cycle 2 Day 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Once your blood sample has been collected, your morning dose of sorafenib will be given to you in the clinic. Before you leave the clinic, you will be given enough sorafenib tablets to last until your next cycle visit. On Cycles 1 2 Days 8 and 15, your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will have a performance status evaluation. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and remaining cycles, you will return all study medication and,or the empty bottle. Your complete medical history will be recorded, and you will have a physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and weight. You will be asked questions to determine how the disease is progressing, and how the disease affects your quality of life. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. Blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will receive infusions of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. You will stay in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after your bevacizumab infusion. Before you leave the clinic, you will be given enough sorafenib to last until the next cycle. On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 3 and remaining cycles, blood (about 5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. On Day 1 of all odd numbered cycles (starting with Cycle 3, 5, 7, 9...), you will have CT scans, MRI scans, and,or other x rays to check the status of the disease. Modified Dose Levels 4 and 5: To find out if interrupted dosing of sorafenib will result in fewer or less severe side effects, 2 additional dose levels, where the dose of sorafenib will be changed (modified), will be performed. For Modified Dose Level 4, sorafenib will be interrupted for 2 days after every 4 5 days . For Modified Dose Level 5, sorafenib will be interrupted for 1 week after 2 weeks of continuous therapy. For these 2 additional dose levels, the sorafenib dosing schedule will be changed. There will be 6 patients enrolled at each dose level. Participants in Dose Level 4 may continue treatment for 4 to 6 cycles. This is done to accurately evaluate the dose level. Researchers will evaluate any side effects related to this new dosing schedule of sorafenib. After all 6 patients have been enrolled in Dose level 4, then 6 additional patients will be enrolled in Dose Level 5. If no intolerable side effects are seen at Dose Level 5, then 6 additional patients can be enrolled in that dose level. This is done so additional PK testing can be done. For Modified Dose Level 4 and 5, on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 2, you will be given bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin in your vein as an infusion. Paclitaxel will be infused over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin over 30 minutes, followed by bevacizumab over 90 minutes for the first 2 cycles. Your bevacizumab infusion may be given over a shorter time period in later cycles. You will stay in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after your bevacizumab infusion for all cycles after 1 and 2.  Modified Dose level 4: For Modified Dose level 4, on Day 3 through Day 19 of Cycle 1, you will receive sorafenib by mouth in the morning, after the morning PK tests have been collected (on Day 3 only). Participants will take the evening dose of sorafenib on their own. After that, participants will take sorafenib on their own twice a day for 5 days on and 2 days off. This will continue through Day 19 on an outpatient basis.

Earlier clinical trials in NSCLC showed that patients treated with NOV 002 in combination with chemotherapy had a better response (their tumors got smaller in one United States Phase 1,2 trial) than patients who received chemotherapy alone; and in two Phase 2 trials done in Russian patients, at the end of one year, patients treated with NOV 002 with chemotherapy had a better survival rate than patients who did not receive NOV 002 with their chemotherapy.","NSCLC is a widespread disease with extremely high mortality and morbidity. Even the most widely accepted standard of care chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, platinum based doublets, are only palliative, providing marginal efficacy as measured by survival. In addition, such chemotherapy is accompanied by severe, sometimes life threatening, toxicities which often limit its application. Thus, there is a clear need for new, more effective and safer therapies for advanced NSCLC. In Phase 2 trials, NOV 002 demonstrated a higher response rate and improved survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced NSCLC, and was well tolerated in this patient group. Thus, we are conducting a large Phase 3 trial of NOV 002 to better define its clinical profile and potential benefit in advanced NSCLC patients. The overall design of this Phase 3 trial reflects major elements of the previous Russian and US clinical trials in advanced NSCLC  it is an open label, randomized controlled trial comparing NOV 002 in combination with first line chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) to first line chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, it is designed and powered to be a pivotal, registrational trial, sufficient for approval. As its primary efficacy endpoint, this Phase 3 trial aims to demonstrate that the combination of NOV 002 with paclitaxel and carboplatin results in improved overall survival when compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone. In addition, several secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed, including progression free survival, tumor response rate and duration of response, quality of life, myelosuppression and immunomodulation. Overall survival was chosen as the primary endpoint of this trial in the context of FDA (Draft) Guidance (Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics, April 2005). This Guidance indicates that an improvement in overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled trials and is of unquestioned clinical benefit. It indicates that the endpoint is precise and easy to measure, documented by the date of death, and states that bias is not a factor in endpoint measurement, and blinding is not essential.

This is a six arm study assessing two treatment arms per tumor type,indication: Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with 1 prior systemic chemotherapy (Arm A, Part 1 only); and subsequently no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease (Arm A, Part 2 and Arm B): Panc Ca Arm A: nab paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1.. Panc Ca Arm B: nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1. Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation: NSCLC Arm C: nab paclitaxel,carboplatin x 4 cycles with nivolumab starting Cycle 1 and continuing as monotherapy starting at Cycle 5..

Enrollment in each treatment arm will be conducted in two sequential parts to allow for the evaluation of the DLT in Part 1 prior to expanding the treatment arm in Part 2. Part 1: Part 1 will assess the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of the nivolumab dose in combination with nab paclitaxel regimens in each treatment arm. Subjects who meet the entry criteria will be assigned to the respective treatment arm based on tumor type and indication as outlined above. Panc Ca Arms A and B, as well as NSCLC Arms C and D, will enroll sequentially in Part 1. The safety of nivolumab in combination with nabpaclitaxel, without gemcitabine, will first be assessed in Arm A in subjects with one prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Panc Ca Arm B may begin enrolling subjects in Part 1, if Panc Ca Arm A is deemed safe, based on DLT criteria. Similarly, NSCLC Arm D will begin to enroll in Part 1 after NSCLC Arm C is deemed safe to expand in Part 2. However, Arm D may be initiated, even if Arm C is not to proceed for Part 2, if the totality of data from Arm C and emerging data from this and other studies in NSCLC with nivolumab in combination with platinum chemotherapy doublets support the decision. Unlike the Panc Ca and NSCLC arms, the two mBC arms (Arms E and F) will be initiated simultaneously. Subjects will be assigned randomly between treatment arms of a tumor type,indication whenever both treatment arms are enrolling. An IRT system will be used to ensure the central random allocation of subjects. Part 2: Treatment arms deemed safe within each tumor type,indication may be expanded using the RP2D with an additional approximately 14 subjects (to attain a total of 20 nivolumab treated subjects) to further assess safety and tolerability, as well as explore anti tumor activity of the proposed regimens. Since the primary population for the pancreas arms is in subjects with no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy, enrollment in Part 2 for Panc Ca Arm A will continue until 20 such subjects have been treated with at least one dose of nivolumab. Additionally, in Parts 1 and 2 overall, each mBC Arm (E and F) will enroll a minimum of 9 subjects with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), treated at the RP2D.

NCT01820754,"Evaluation of Circulating T Cells and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) During , After Pre Surgery Chemotherapy in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)","The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before surgery) plus ipilimumab for lung cancer increases the number of patients with detectable circulating T cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens (TAA) from zero percent (0%) of patients prior to therapy to 20% of patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. This is an open label Phase 2 trial. Patients with clinical stage 1B (>4 cm), 2, (N0 2) or 3 non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no prior therapy for the current diagnosis of lung cancer will be eligible for the study. Subjects will receive 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel + cisplatin,carboplatin). Ipilimumab will be administered during Cycles 2 and 3 of standard chemotherapy and for up to 4 cycles alone after surgery. Subjects will undergo standard clinically indicated surgical resection of their lung cancer as deemed appropriate by their surgeon. Standard diagnostic and staging work up will be performed including: pathologic,histologic diagnosis of NSCLC, Positron Emission Tomography (PET),Computed Tomography (CT) scan, brain imaging, and mediastinoscopy. Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be given. Ipilimumab will be added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cycles 2 and 3. Standard surgical evaluation and therapy will be performed following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Two cycles of single agent ipilimumab will be given after surgery (adjuvantly), followed by 2 cycles of maintenance therapy.","The investigators propose studying the cell mediated effects of ipilimumab in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for NSCLC. The overall immune assessment strategy for the proposed ipilimumab neoadjuvant trial will be based on the hypothesis that 1) T cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens expressed by the patients progressing NSCLC are present, but functionally impaired, at baseline, and 2) that the immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab will impact the suppressive mechanisms, restoring functional reactivity to important anti tumor effector cell populations. An important potential biomarker for anti tumor immune response is the proliferation and stimulation of circulating T cells with specificities against tumor associated antigens (TAA). At baseline few patients with cancer have populations of circulating T cells with specificities against TAA above the detectable level of 0.05% CD8 lymphocytes. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial will be to determine if the addition of ipilimumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non small cell lung cancer increases the percentage of patients with circulating T cells with specificities against TAA. We will also measure tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in resected tumors. Study Interventions: The investigational agent, ipilimumab, will be added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cycles 2 and 3. Standard surgical evaluation and therapy will be performed following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Two cycles of single agent ipilimumab will be given after surgery (adjuvantly), followed by 2 cycles of maintenance therapy.

NCT01540045,"Effect of Chemotherapy With Paclitaxel,Cisplatin on Development Dysgeusia in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","One of the most widely used treatments for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the combination of paclitaxel cisplatin. These drugs may contribute to taste alterations like dysgeusia. Which alters the feeding of cancer patients, contributing to the anorexia, weight loss and malnutrition, which leads to a prognostic impact in a lower patient response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical treatment as well as increased toxic effects, impacting treatment discontinuation and therefore, morbidity and survival of patients. The objective of this study is to describe the threshold of perception and recognition of basic tastes in patients with NSCLC before treatment with platin and paclitaxel based chemotherapy and after the second cycle, and analyze the effect in the developement of dysgeusia, as well as the association between these and the nutritional status and quality of life.","Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from malignancies in our country. It was recently reported to induce 11.5% of cancer deaths in Mexico, with a rate of 6.5 per 100 000 people. Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of all lung cancer cases. Less than 20% has resectable disease and in the National Cancer Institute of Mexico exclusively less than 2%, representing chemotherapy the standard of care in these patients. One of the most widely used drug combinations is paclitaxel cisplatin. It has been reported a prevalence of malnutrition in 60 to 79% in this type of cancer, being the major contributor to morbidity and mortality. The etiology resides both in the systemic effects of the tumor and toxic effects of treatment as low levels hematologic, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, anorexia, dysgeusia, among others. Weight loss has a strong impact on the response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, as well as increased toxic effects impacting the discontinuation of treatment and is considered an independent predictor of survival for most patients with NSCLC. Is estimated that over 20% of cancer patients the cause of death are inanition effects. Among the most frequent symptoms in advanced unresectable cancer or its treatment that may affect food intake and hence nutritional status, are the early satiety and dysgeusia (61% and 46% respectively). As are difficult to change early satiety, dysgeusia is a field for selecting strategies in its management. The dysgeusia is defined as a change in taste that can manifest as a distortion of taste, lack of taste (ageusia), decreased sensitivity of perception (hypogeusia) or increased sensitivity to some or all flavors (hypergeusia). The development of dysgeusia have clinical significance in the etiology of cancer anorexia because it can affect eating habits and contribute to weight loss or malnutrition and consequently affect the quality of life. The chemotherapy may contribute to dysgeusia. It has reported a prevalence of 56.3% of Dysgeusia in cancer patients under this type of treatment. As well, zinc deficiency has been associated with the hypogeusia, this metal to be involved at various levels in the physiology of the role of taste at various levels of cell several organization. Several studies have linked consumption dysgeusia with energy and macronutrients, weight loss, lack of appetite and early satiety. The type of tumor, stage, chemotherapy regimen and serum zinc levels are associated with dysgeusia, but the exact mechanism underlining these disturbances are not known at totality. No known if chemotherapy or before this is presented dysgeusia. In addition there are few studies in this area and with methodological weaknesses, among which include heterogeneous population (patients with a diagnosis of malignancy of breast, lung, prostate, multiple myeloma and lymphoma), different patterns of treatment(different chemotherapy drugs, radiotherapy schedules and combination of both forms of measurement of dysgeusia, besides the absence of dysgeusia baseline evaluation before chemotherapy to establish a causal association between chemotherapy and taste alteration. Also, is unknown if dysgeusia impact on body composition determined by bioelectrical impedance, phase angle in and consumption of micronutrients (iron, sodium, zinc, B6, B12). Thats why is necessary to continue studying this phenomenon to develop a better understanding of the nature, frequency, severity and duration of dysgeusia in patients with advanced lung cancer, the role that zinc exerts in its development and its impact on consumption food, anthropometric parameters and quality of life in such patients before and after chemotherapy in the same regimen of chemotherapy.",Completed,All,18 Years,90 Years,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Dysgeusia, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Paclitaxel, Cisplatin","Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, Change from Baseline in threshold of perception at 6 weeks, pre  post chemotherapy (6 weeks), pre  post chemotherapy (6 weeks), pre  post chemotherapy (6 weeks)",,,,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Dysgeusia, Taste Disorders, Lung Neoplasms, Small Cell Lung Carcinoma",

NCT00861627,Phase 2 Study of REOLYSIN® in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS or EGFR Activation,The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of a wild type reovirus (REOLYSIN®) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective and safe in the treatment of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer with KRAS or EGFR activation.,"Reovirus Serotype 3  Dearing Strain (REOLYSIN®) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, non enveloped human reovirus. Reovirus has been shown to replicate selectively in Ras transformed cells causing cell lysis. Activating mutations in ras or mutation in oncogenes signaling through the ras pathway may occur in as many as 80% of human tumors. The specificity of the reovirus for Ras transformed cells, coupled with its relatively nonpathogenic nature in humans, makes it an attractive anti cancer therapy candidate. Given the ability of reovirus to replicate and cause oncolysis in Ras activated cells, the high incidence of K ras mutations in lung cancers, and the Ras mediated activation often encountered in EGFR addicted tumors, the administration of REOLYSIN® in combination with chemotherapy is expected to result in enhanced clinical benefit in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with K ras mutations and,or EGFR aberrant activation in their tumors. Patients with de novo or acquired EGFR mutations in their tumors that confer resistance to EGFR TKIs (e.g. T790) are expected to benefit as well. This is a single arm, open label, Phase 2 study of REOLYSIN® given intravenously with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks (21 days is defined as a cycle) in NSCLC patients with tumors driven by these pathways. Paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg,m2 will be given i.v. as a 3 hour infusion on Day 1 followed by carboplatin given i.v. AUC 5 mg,mL•minute. REOLYSIN® will be given over 60 min on Day 1 (starting after completion of the carboplatin infusion), and on Days 2  5. The treatment cycle will be repeated every 21 days. Patients will receive 4 to 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin, at the treating physicians discretion according to standard of practice, in conjunction with REOLYSIN®. After completion of the 4 to 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin, REOLYSIN® may be continued as monotherapy Days 1 5 of each 21 day cycle until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue to receive therapy under this protocol, provided they have not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug related toxicity that does not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"REOLYSIN, reovirus, non small cell lung cancer, carcinoma, oncolytics virus, chemotherapy, paclitaxel, carboplatin","For PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non small Cell Lung","REOLYSIN®, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel"

NCT00034346,ABX EGF in Combination With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for the Treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor types, suggesting a self propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth. Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX EGF, a fully human monoclonal antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors.

NCT00533949,High Dose or Standard Dose Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III Non Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether high dose radiation therapy is more effective than standard dose radiation therapy when given together with combination chemotherapy with or without cetuximab in treating patients with non small cell lung cancer.

The safety of this treatment will also be studied.,"A proton beam is made up of charged particles that have a well defined range of penetration into tissues. How deep it can penetrate is decided by both the beams energy and the density of the tissue through which it passes. As the proton beam penetrates the body, the particles slow down, and the beam deposits its dose sharply near the end of its range. This is a phenomenon known as the Bragg peak. By adjusting the Bragg peak, the doctor can deliver a full, localized, uniform dose of energy to the treatment site while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. The proton beam is ideal for treatments where organ preservation is very important, such as lung cancer. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 37 treatments of proton radiotherapy (Monday through Friday for 7 1,2 weeks). During the treatment, you will lie still on a table for about 30 45 minutes per day in the same position.

NCT01100931,"A Phase I,II Study of Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and YM155 (Survivin Suppressor) in Subjects With Solid Tumors (Phase I) and Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (Phase II)","Background: Carboplatin paclitaxel is a commonly used chemotherapy combination for advanced non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and other solid tumors. In a randomized clinical trial, the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and the additional chemotherapy drug bevacizumab had a better response rate and survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone. However, this trial treated only patients with a specific diagnosis and treatment risks. Further research is needed to determine whether this combination is useful for other diagnoses.. YM155 is a drug that targets a type of chemical often found in cancer cells. It has been investigated in several phase I and phase II clinical trials, and it has been shown to be well tolerated and moderately effective in treating advanced NSCLC in patients who had not responded well to one or two standard treatments. Objectives:  To determine the efficacy of the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and YM155 in the treatment of non small cell lung cancer. Eligibility:  Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with advanced non small cell lung carcinoma or other solid tumors for which standard therapy is not likely to be effective. Design: Before the start of the study, participants will be screened with a medical history, blood tests, imaging scans of the affected areas, tumor biopsies, and other tests as directed by the study doctors.. Participants will be treated for six 21 day cycles, or 18 weeks of treatment. Each cycle will include blood tests and imaging studies as required.. On day 1 of each cycle, participants will receive an infusion of paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by a 4 day infusion of YM155 (through a portable electronic infusion pump).. Participants will have a computed tomography scan or other imaging every other cycle (approximately every 6 weeks) to determine whether the therapy is affecting the cancer site.. After the sixth cycle, participants will return for follow up visits at least every 3 months, and will be asked to remain in contact with the researchers to allow further study of the long term effects of the treatment.","Background: Treatment with platinum based doublet chemotherapy results in a median survival of 7 to 10 months in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).. Carboplatin paclitaxel is a commonly used regimen in advanced NSCLC and other solid tumors. In a randomized clinical trial carboplatin, paclitaxel plus bevacizumab resulted in improved efficacy (response rate and survival) compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone but only patients with non squamous histology and who were considered low risk of bleeding were treated. Improvement of survival was not confirmed in another randomized study with a different chemotherapy backbone.. Novel treatment strategies need to be developed for advanced NSCLC.. YM155 is a transcriptional inhibitor of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Pre clinical activity of YM155 has been observed in several solid tumors, including NSCLC models and synergy was observed in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, including carboplatin and paclitaxel.. YM155 has been investigated in several phase I and phase II clinical trials and it has been shown to be well tolerated with the most common toxicities reported as being reversible and of grades 1 2 in severity. In addition, as a monotherapy YM155 alone has shown modest antitumor activity in a phase II trial in advanced NSCLC in patients who had failed one or two prior chemotherapy lines. Primary Objectives: In the Phase I portion of the study the primary objective will be to determine a safe and tolerable phase II dose of YM155 based upon dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) when YM155 is administered over 72 hours by continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) every 3 weeks in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.. In the Phase II portion of the study the primary objective will be to determine the objective response rate (ORR = partial response (PR)+ complete response (CR)) of YM155 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the first line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Secondary Objectives: In the Phase I portion of the study the secondary objective will be to determine the preliminary activity of the combination regimen based upon response rate as measured by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors RECIST.. In the Phase II portion of the study the secondary objectives will be to determine the median progression free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS) and safety and tolerability of this combination regimen in this patient population.. To assess expression of particular genes on the pretreatment tumor and pre,post treatment serum samples to evaluate the treatment effects and correlate them with clinical outcome. Eligibility: Phase I  The phase I portion of the trial will be open to all patients with recurrent or advanced cancer (NSCLC and other solid tumors) for whom standard therapy offers no curative potential and also in patients for whom the carboplatin , paclitaxel regimen is considered standard of care.

NCT04640935,Paclitaxel in Combination With Bevacizumab in Patients With Stage IV NSCLC.,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the paclitaxel bevacizumab combination retrospectively and multicenter in current practice, with subgroup analyses of the following patients: patients who have previously received immunotherapy, patients with an EGFR or ALK oncogenic addiction pathway, patients who have previously received taxanes or anti angiogenic agents.","Lung and bronchopulmonary cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in France and worldwide. It is diagnosed at the metastatic stage from the outset in approximately 50% of cases. Non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are the most frequent histological forms of lung cancer (approximately 85% of cases) with a predominance of the non epidermal type. The increase in the number of treatments available, improved supportive care and better patient selection have, in recent years, made it possible to expand the range of first line chemotherapy treatments available at delà̀ and have contributed to the increase in overall survival (OS). As a result, nearly 80% of patients with metastatic NSCLC receive a second line of treatment. The main objective in these often symptomatic patients is a satisfactory tumor control rate with acceptable tolerability. For a long time, the second line reference chemotherapy has been docetaxel or pemetrexed as monotherapy with modest results. Alternative treatments such as the combination of paclitaxel (chemotherapy) bevacizumab (anti angiogenic monoclonal antibody) have been studied. Since 2010, by analogy with breast cancer and in the absence of therapeutic alternatives, the paclitaxel bevacizumab doublet has been used in non epidermal stage IV NSCLC in France. The value of combining taxane chemotherapy with an anti angiogenic molecule has been demonstrated in two Phase 3 clinical trials. Thus, this combination is an integral part of the possible treatments in 2nd line and beyond, registered since 2016 in the treatment guidelines for non epidermal NSCLC. The first line therapeutic strategy will also be redefined in 2019 with the use of immunotherapy for a majority of patients. Subsequent treatment lines will be modified, with a focus on chemotherapy, in particular the paclitaxel bevacizumab combination. As this combination has been used in current practice for several years, and in view of the upcoming changes to the first and second line of NSCLC treatment, data on the efficacy and tolerance of this combination in real life are needed to guide our practices. Recent studies are also looking at the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly taxane chemotherapy associated with an anti angiogenic agent after a previous line including immunotherapy, with a favorable signal. The aim of the study is to evaluate the paclitaxel bevacizumab combination retrospectively and multicenter in current practice, with subgroup analyses of the following patients: patients who have previously received immunotherapy, patients with an EGFR or ALK oncogenic addiction pathway, patients who have previously received taxanes or anti angiogenic agents.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Non small cell lung cancers, Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab",Up to 12 months,,,,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,

The study aims to determine if chemotherapy combined with immune based therapy can lead to improvement in tumor response rates over historical response rates with chemotherapy alone.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women worldwide, accounting for 13% of incident cancers. In 2015, it was estimated there would be 221,200 new lung cancers diagnosed in the United States, with 158,040 lung cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are characterized as non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Repeated studies have shown neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to be safe prior to surgical resection of NSCLC with no difference in extent of surgical procedures performed, operative morbidity and mortality. The debate remains as to whether neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is the best approach, with advantages and disadvantages to each. The investigators propose that new therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors that demonstrate promising clinical activity in the advanced disease setting must be incorporated into the neoadjuvant setting, in order to maximize benefit early in a patients treatment course, and with a suitable surrogate endpoint that can be used to establish a preliminary efficacy signal, prior to initiation of a large confirmatory study.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC",84 days,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung","MPDL3280A, Carboplatin, Nab paclitaxel"

The standard of care in the United States for those patients with unresectable Stage IIIA,B and a good performance status (PS) is a combination of systemic chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy (TRT). What is not clear in the management of these patients is the optimal strategy to employ in the combined modality approach, as well as the optimal chemotherapy and radiation therapy dose and schedule. Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy for Stage IIIA,B NSCLC The use of combined modality has become the standard of care in unresectable Stage IIIA,B non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the curative approach to this disease, both local control and eradication of occult micrometastatic disease must be achieved. Combined modality trials employing induction chemotherapy have suggested a reduction in the rate of metastatic disease, suggesting that effectively delivered chemotherapy can eradicate occult micrometastatic disease. All of the trials cited have shown improved survival for the combined modality arm. Combined modality trials employing concurrent chemoradiation have suggested improved loco regional control resulting in improved survival. These data suggest that both induction and concurrent treatment may be important and may exert their benefit in different manners: induction therapy with effective chemotherapy reduces the rate of overt metastatic disease, while concurrent treatment improves local control by enhancing the local effect of TRT. Four trials to date have been published addressing sequential versus concurrent therapy. In these trials, concurrent treatment yielded improved survival over the sequential approach. The value of either induction or consolidation therapy in addition to concurrent chemotherapy is currently being addressed in randomized Phase III trials. The study will evaluate the incorporation of ZD1839 with concurrent CP and TCRT to a dose of 74 Gy following 2 cycles of induction CIP. The primary objective will be to define the toxicity profile of this approach. With amendment 2, patients will no longer receive maintenance ZD1839. Given the data generated on LCCC 9603 and 2001, this hybrid platform of induction CIP followed by concurrent TCRT (74 Gy) and CP seems appropriate for incorporation of ZD1839 because of the general tolerance of this therapy in good PS, unresectable, Stage III NSCLC subjects. Given that esophagitis is the primary toxicity seen with this approach, stopping rules will be in place for excessive esophageal toxicity.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"unresectable, induction, radiotherapy, ZD1839","60 days, 42 days",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, CPT 11, Pegfilgrastim, Conformal radiotherapy"
NCT01486602,Specialized Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery,"This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of hypofractionated radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III non small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerable radiotherapy (RT) dose fraction for accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the rate of radiographic response to treatment. II. To estimate the rates of progression: local,regional,distant. III. To estimate the progression free survival. IV. To estimate the overall survival. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy. CONCURRENT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy using 3 dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 4 5.5 weeks. CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NCT00563784,"TARCEVA (Erlotinib) in Combination With Chemoradiation in Patients With Stage IIIA,B Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)",The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if erlotinib given with chemotherapy and radiation therapy can help to control NSCLC. The safety of this combination treatment will also be studied. Researchers will also test the tissue from your earlier biopsy to measure the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The purpose of EGFR testing is to learn about any link between various forms of EGFR and your response to treatment with erlotinib.,"Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGFR). EGFR is found on the surface of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing. Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have screening tests. These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will have a FEV1 (breathing test). You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate). Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to check the status of the disease. You will be required to have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to locate the area of cancer outside the chest and lymph glands. You will have either a CT scan or an MRI to measure the size of the tumor(s). If there is positive finding of CT or MRI you will be taken off study. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG  a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). If you have a significant history of cardiovascular disease, you will have a MUGA scan and echocardiogram to test your heart function. Women who are able to have children must have a negative urine or blood (about 2 teaspoons) pregnancy test before starting treatment. You will have PET scan 1 month after completion of consolidation chemotherapy. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take erlotinib every day for 7 weeks (except on the days you receive chemotherapy). The erlotinib tablets should be taken at the same time each day, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, with a small glass (about 7 ounces) of water. If you are unable to swallow tablets, you may dissolve the tablets in distilled water to drink. You will receive radiation every day (Monday through Friday) for 7 weeks. You will also receive chemotherapy through a needle in a vein once a week for 7 weeks. The chemotherapy will include carboplatin and paclitaxel. Receiving chemotherapy will take about 6 hours total. You will receive consolidation therapy on weeks 11 17. Treatment on this study will last 17 weeks. Once a week during that time, you will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests. You will also have a CT scan of the chest within about 4 weeks from beginning the study, 2 months after finishing therapy, and then every 6 months after that for 2 years. The CT scans are used to check the status of the disease. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. In this case, you would not receive erlotinib anymore but would continue standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy. You will be asked to come in to the clinic for follow up visits to check on your recovery from treatment. The follow up visits will be at the end of all treatment, 1 month after treatment, and then once a month for as long as your doctor feels it is necessary. Once your side effects have become less severe, you will be asked to come in to the clinic for follow up visits every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months for the following 2 years after that. You will have a physical exam, and your medical history will be recorded. You will be asked about any side effects you may have. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a PET scan. You have the right to leave the study at any time. If you choose to stop participating in this study, you should contact the study chair and,or research nurse. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if your medical condition gets worse and,or you are unable to comply with study requirements. At the end of the study you will not be automatically notified of the research findings. If you wish to learn about the results, however, you may request them from the study chair. This is an investigational study. All three study drugs are commercially available. Carboplatin, and paclitaxel are FDA approved for the treatment of NSCLC, but their use in combination with erlotinib is not. Erlotinib is FDA approved for some uses, but it has not been approved by the FDA to treat lung cancer patients like yourself who have not yet undergone chemotherapy; however, the FDA has permitted its use in this research study. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are considered standard of care treatment and you would probably be treated with these drugs or similar drugs even if you decided not to be in the study.

In 2008, there was an estimated 215,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and roughly 162,000 deaths from lung cancer (NCI 2009). The majority (85%) of patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer will have non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has become the most commonly prescribed chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the United States. Laboratory studies of combinations of REOLYSIN with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents has shown that the combination of REOLYSIN and paclitaxel was invariably synergistic, even in cells with drug resistance or limited sensitivity to the reovirus. Moreover, reovirus activity was dramatically increased in the presence of the taxane. The Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with squamous cell carinoma of the lung. Response is a primary endpoint of this trial. The safety of the treatment combination will be assessed by the evaluation of the type, frequency and severity of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests, immunogenicity and physical examination. Patients may continue to receive chemotherapy combined with REOLYSIN for up to 8 cycles and may continue indefinitely on REOLYSIN monotherapy under this protocol, provided they have not experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug related toxicity that does not respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"carcinoma, squamous cell, lung, REOLYSIN, chemotherapy, carboplatin, paclitaxel, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell of the Lung",6 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Metastatic or Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung,"REOLYSIN, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin"

Even treatments that attempt to specifically target NSCLC cells have not proved effective.. Researchers are interested in determining whether a combination of the chemotherapy drugs SS1 (dsFv) PE38, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab may be effective in shrinking the size of NSCLC tumors. Three of the drugs (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab) are commercially available, while the other is a drug that is currently being tested to determine its usefulness in cancer treatment. This study will help to determine if the combination of all four drugs is more effective and as safe, safer, or less safe than other drug combinations given to treat NSCLC.

NCT00259675,"Alternating Cycles of Carboplatin,Gemcitabine and Carboplatin,Taxol for Advanced Stage NSCLC",To see the efficacy of using chemotherapies alternatively (carboplatin and gemcitabine alternating with carboplatin and taxol) for pts with stage IIIB (nonresectable and stage IV NSCLC.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the USA, and account for 28% of all cancer deaths in 2002 (1). In stage IV and some patients with stage III disease chemotherapy is widely used with the primary aim of prolonging survival and ,or palliating symptoms. A meta analysis of clinical studies that randomized patients between the best supportive care and chemotherapy concluded that Cisplatin based chemotherapy resulted in a potential gain in the median survival and an increase of the 1 year survival rate compared to the supportive care alone (2). Combination chemotherapy regimens (Platinum,Taxanes, Platinum,Gemcitabine, Platinum,Vinca alkaloids) have demonstrated a response rate of 30 50% with median survival of approximately 10 months, one year survival rates around 40%, and 2 year survival of only 10 % in patients with advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (3,4). Therefore it is important to continue to search for new agents,combinations that can be used to improve the overall prognosis of these patients. Rationale for using alternating cycles of chemotherapies: Emergence of progressive or recurrent disease is a consequence of selection and overgrowth of pre existent, drug resistant cells during treatment. Based on the mechanism of somatic cell mutation, Goldie and Coldman (5,6) proposed a model for the emergence of drug resistant cells in tumors. Their model proposed that alternating non cross resistant combinations would prevent the overgrowth of resistant cancer cells and improve the probability of tumor control or cure. Their recommendation assumed that the two non cross resistant regimens were of equal or similar efficacy and that the drugs contained in the two combinations could not be administered together in one single regimen. There are few instances in Clinical Oncology where two regimens of similar efficacy exist for the same tumor type. Since apparently equivalent chemotherapy regimens exist for the treatment of NSCLC, the Goldie and Coldman hypothesis could also be tested in this tumor type. Historically, SWOG conducted a phase III trial randomizing patients between FOMi (5 Fluorouracil,Vincristine,MitomycinC), CAP (Cyclophosphamide,Doxorubicin,Cisplatin) and a third arm FOMi,CAP, which alternated the two combinations. Response rates were 26%, 17% and 22%, respectively, and were not statistically significantly different (P=0 .247). Survival was reported as 20, 24 and 23 weeks, respectively. Statistically survival of FOMi,CAP treated patients was superior to FOMi treated (P=0.024) but not CAP treated (P=0.23) patients (7). Since then, several studies have attempted to improve upon the response rate and survival in advanced NSCLC by using regimens with alternating cycles of non cross resistant therapy (8,9,10,11). These regimens yielded overall response rate of 21 49%, median survival of 20 48 wks with acceptable toxicity. Though several studies have been done to evaluate clinical response in lung cancer using alternating chemotherapies, none of these studies have evaluated clinical response with alternating Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine based treatment which are two of the most effective chemotherapy regimens in use currently. In studies of Platinum combinations that included one of these agents, results were better than those achieved with Platinum alone or combined with earlier generation agents such as Vindesine or Etoposide (12). Current evidence suggests that combinations of Paclitaxel or Gemcitabine with Cisplatin or Carboplatin are among the most active palliative treatments for advanced NSCLC. With combination of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine a response rate in phase II trials ranged from 30 54%, with median survival times of approximately 8 15 months and I year survival rates from 34 61% (13,14). Myelosuppression was the major toxicity, while Cisplatin associated nonhematologic gastrointestinal, renal and neurologic effects were also problematic. Attempts to reduce toxicity associated with the Cisplatin, Gemcitabine regimen have included replacing Cisplatin with Carboplatin, a platinum analog possessing similar efficacy and hematologic effects, but lacking the non hematologic toxicity commonly experienced with Cisplatin therapy (15,16). Furthermore Carboplatin can be administered with no need for prehydration to avoid renal toxicity. In several phase II studies of the Carboplatin,Gemcitabine regimen in patients with stages IIIB and IV NSCLC, objective response rate ranged from 25% 59%, with median survival of 10 16 months (17,18). In a phase II trial, Carrato et al (19) compared 21 day and 28 day schedules of the Gemcitabine,Carboplatin regimen in 75 advanced NSCLC patients. Patients received Gemcitabine 1000mg,m2 on days 1,8 and 15 with Carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1 every 28 days, or a modified regimen omitting the day 15 Gemcitabine dose and repeating cycles every 21 days. Incidence of grades 3 and 4 neutropenia were 52% and 38%, respectively with the 28 day regimen, and decreased to 39% and 23% with the modified regimen. Significant reductions in rates of grades 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia were noted from 45% and 61%, respectively, in the 28 day cohort to 24% (P=0.04) and 17% (P=0.002) respectively, in the 21 day group. Response rate (46% and 37%, respectively) and median survival time (38 wks for both schedules) were maintained in both groups of patients. Furthermore, higher dose intensities of both Gemcitabine and Carboplatin were achieved every 3 wk vs every 4 wk schedules (Gemcitabine 1,133 v 1,002 mg,wk: Carboplatin 162 v 124 mg,wk) (20). Results from current phase III trials (21,22) are also consistent in showing good activity and tolerability of the Carboplatin,Gemcitabine combination in advanced NSCLC, and establish this regimen as an appealing approach for treating this disease. On the basis of above discussion we have chosen Carboplatin,Gemcitabine as one of the doublets we will use in our study. The other doublet we are using in our study is Carboplatin,Paclitaxel. Several studies have shown response rate of approximately 30% with median survival 8 11 months (23,24,25). Toxicity was mild. Grades 3,4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia were seen in 15%, 2% and 5% respectively (25). Dose finding studies (26,27) of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in advanced NSCLC have shown that doses of Paclitaxel higher than 175 mg,m2 prolongs the median time to progression but causes more neurotoxicity and leucopenia. Also, better response rate, the longer overall and better one year survival seen with the higher dose of Paclitaxel were not statistically significant. Rationale for using Gemcitabine and Paclitaxel (alternatively in the same regimen) for NSCLC is provided by their antitumor activity, different mechanism of cytotoxicity and different toxicity profiles. In an in vitro study (28) Jensen PB et al has shown collateral sensitivity between Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in seven resistant small cell lung cancer cell lines. The importance of evaluating the impact of any therapy on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with malignancy has been demonstrated in recent literature (29). Patients with advanced NSCLC suffer from a variety of treatment related challenges and do not have an expectation of cure. Hence, it is particularly important to compare treatment alternatives not only on survival endpoints but also on QOL. Therefore, we propose to incorporate QOL evaluations in the proposed clinical trial. QOL instrument we are using is the FACT L (version 4). The FACT L is a validated 36 item Likert instrument that combines both relative frequency of symptomatic,quality of life problems with the patients perceived relative importance of each issue (30). Can we use Taxotere as second line agent if patient had received Paclitaxel as first line agent? In comparison with best supportive care, Docetaxel (Taxotere) has shown a benefit in overall survival for the second line treatment of NSCLC (31,32). Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel were excluded from TAX 317 trial (29). But in TAX 320 trial (30) many patients had received Paclitaxel prior to enrollment (31% of patients in Docetaxel 100 mg arm, 42% of patients in the Docetaxel 75 mg arm and 41% of patients in the control arm. Authors were able to evaluate retrospectively, what impact, if any, prior Paclitaxel exposure may have had on response and survival with Docetaxel. Partial response rates were equivalent in the cohort of 91 patients who had received prior Paclitaxel (10.5%) and the group of 157 patients who had not received prior Paclitaxel (8.5%). In a similar analysis of survival data, prior Paclitaxel therapy had no bearing on the survival advantage seen with Docetaxel.",Completed,All,19 Years,75 Years,,,Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"carboplatin,gemcitabine, carboplatin,taxol"

Phase II: a prospective, single arm, multicentre study of a fixed dose of F16IL2 in combination with paclitaxel, equivalent to stage 1 of the Simon two stage phase II design, for patients with metastatic melanoma, breast cancer and NSCLC amenable to taxane therapy.","Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer mortality, second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in women. The five year survival rate for localized breast cancer has increased from 80 percent in the 1950s to 98 percent today. However, the mortality rate in the most advanced forms remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, the extensive use of mammography within screening programs has led to cancers being detected earlier, when early treatments may be more effective. A greater understanding of the molecular biology and genetic expression of breast cancer has therefore led to new pre surgical and post surgical treatments, including hormone modulators and monoclonal antibodies. Many of these agents have led to decreased mortality and disease recurrence. F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv (single chain Fragment variable) format that is directed against tenascin C, an angiogenesis marker common to most solid tumors independent of the tumor type. ScFv(F16) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours. IL2, the human cytokine interleukin 2, is a potent stimulator of the immune response. It has a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such as natural killer cells, B cells, monocyte,macrophages and neutrophils (Smith, 1988). IL2 can induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell mediated immune response in vivo (Rosenberg, 2000).",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Interleukin, IL2, F16, monoclonal, antibody, cytokine Paclitaxel, breast cancer,solid tumour, metastatic melanoma, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","28 days, 8 weeks",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Solid Tumor, Breast Cancer, Metastatic Melanoma, Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)",F16IL2 in combination with paclitaxel

NCT00915005,"Trial of Image Guided Adaptive Conformal Photon vs Proton Therapy, With Concurrent Chemotherapy, for Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma: Treatment Related Pneumonitis and Locoregional Recurrence","The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if, compared with regular x ray radiation, proton radiation reduces the risk of developing, treatment related pneumonitis (TRP) or tumor recurrence (the tumor coming back in the irradiated area after treatment) in patients with lung cancer.","There are 2 types of radiation treatment being used in this study. One type of treatment is proton therapy. Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a beam of proton particles (similar to getting an x ray) to send radiation inside the body to the tumor. The other type of treatment is Image Guided Adaptive Photon Therapy (IGAPT). IGAPT is a therapy that uses images to help guide the delivery of photon therapy to the tumor. Both of these types of radiation treatment are believed to help doctors to give a full dose of radiation treatment to the tumor while not damaging as much of the healthy tissue around it. Study Groups If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will go through the standard radiation treatment planning procedure, called the marking session. After the marking session, a standard photon therapy plan (called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, or IMRT) and a proton plan will be developed. If the radiation oncologist thinks that both the photon and proton plans are acceptable, you will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive photon therapy. Participants in Group 2 will receive proton therapy. The first 20 participants will have an equal chance to be assigned to either group. After at least 20 participants have been enrolled and there has been at least 1 occurrence of pneumonitis and,or tumor recurrence in each treatment Group, the risk of pneumonitis and,or tumor recurrence in all previous participants will be evaluated for each treatment Group, and that information will be used to calculate the chances of being assigned to either Group 1 or Group 2. This calculation will be updated after each occurrence of pneumonitis and,or tumor recurrence and after each participant returns for a follow up visit. Once these calculations are begun, everyone who joins the study from that point on will be more likely to be assigned to the treatment Group that appears to be better in terms of pneumonitis and,or tumor recurrence. If the tumor is too large and the standard radiation treatment plan created during the marking session is found not to be acceptable, and the radiation oncologist thinks radiation treatment it is necessary, you will still remain on study and be assigned to a third group. If you are assigned to Group 3, you will receive proton or photon treatment at a lower dose level and,or reduced length of radiation. If you are assigned to Group 2 and your insurance provider denies reimbursement, you may chose not to receive proton therapy and receive photon therapy instead. If you chose to receive photon therapy, you will be in Group 4. Radiation Therapy Administration Both radiation therapy treatments (photon and proton) are given through a radiation machine called an accelerator. The radiation therapy administration process is very similar to the way that a CT scan is performed. You will lay on a table and the treatment machine rotates around you without touching your body. Each daily treatment should take about 20 30 minutes to complete. Most of this time is used to position you correctly before the machine is turned on. The actual time used to give the radiation should take about 3 5 minutes each day. While you are on this study and if you are in Groups 1 or 2, you will receive a total of 37 radiation treatments. Radiation is given 5 days a week for about 7 1,2 weeks. If you are in Group 1, you will receive photon radiation treatment in the main hospital. If you are in Group 2, you will receive proton therapy in the proton treatment center (PTC). If you are in Group 3, you will receive either photon or proton therapy, whichever your doctor decides is better for you, for 6 7 1,2 weeks. If your doctor decides that photon therapy is better you will receive your treatment in the main hospital. If your doctor decides that proton therapy is better you will receive your treatment in the Proton Therapy Center. If you are in Group 4, you will receive Photon radiation treatment in the main hospital. Chemotherapy You will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy 1 time a week over 7 weeks. Each treatment will last 3 4 hours. Paclitaxel will be given by vein over 1 hour and carboplatin will be given by vein over 30 minutes. You will receive this chemotherapy combination with radiation therapy, as part of your treatment on this study. Your chemotherapy may also be decided by your treating medical oncologist as long as the therapy is allowed by the study. Study Visits During Chemoradiation At least 1 time each week for all study participants, you will have study tests performed. During this weekly study visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed: You will have a physical exam. You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET,CT scan performed to check the status of the disease during Week 4 or 5 of treatment. Length of Study You will remain on study as long you are benefiting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, you experience intolerable side effects, or your doctor thinks that it is no longer in your best interest to receive the study treatment. Follow Up Visits After you have completed chemoradiation, the study staff or study nurse will contact you 1 time each month to ask you about any symptoms you may have until 6 months after chemoradiation. Each phone call should last about 10 minutes. You will have your first follow up visit 4 8 weeks after you have completed chemoradiation. You will have additional follow up visits every 3 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and then 1 time every year after that. At the first and second follow up visit the following tests and procedures will be performed: You will have positron emission tomography (PET),computed tomography (CT) scans and single proton emission tomography (SPECT) scans to check the status of your lungs and heart if the radiation or medical oncologist thinks it is necessary. Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the radiation oncologist or medical oncologist thinks it is needed, at the follow up visits, you will have breathing function tests performed to check your lung function for up to 1 year after the study treatment is complete. For this test, the radiation oncologist, medical oncologist or study nurse will have you breathe into a special machine. The radiation oncologist or medical oncologist will decide how many tests are to be performed each time. PET,CT and SPECT scans will be performed again at any time the radiation oncologist or medical oncologist thinks they are needed. Other tests may be performed if the study doctor (radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, surgeon or pulmonologist) thinks they are needed. This is an investigational study.

In this study safety and tolerability of multiple administrations of Quisinostat in doses ranging from 8 mg to 12 mg combined with standard backbone chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer (second line) and ovarian cancer (second and subsequent lines) will be investigated.","It was proven that Quisinostat increases HDAC1 inhibited E cadherin expression (at the low concentrations of 30 nM) which increases susceptibility to epidermal growth factor inhibitors in case of non small cell lung cancer and stops proliferation of paclitaxel resistant cells. Thus, besides its own efficacy, which can potentially lead to better results of polychemotherapy and increase the mean time to progression, it may be demonstrated that Quisinostat leads to sustained tumor sensitivity to platinum drugs and possibly to resensitiztion in case of acquired or primary resistance. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Quisinostat in multiple ascending doses and establish its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), administered in combination with standard backbone chemotherapy, as follows: Gemcitabine + Cisplatin in patients with non small cell lung cancer (second line) and Paclitaxel + Carboplatin in patients with non small cell lung cancer (second line) and in patients with ovarian cancer (second and subsequent lines).

NCT03128008,Locally Advanced NSCLC Hyperfractionated RT,"This is a prospective phase II study designed to evaluate an accelerated and adaptive RT approach for locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All eligible subjects will have an interim PET CT during radiation therapy to determine the metabolic complete response rate. Radiation therapy will be given in an accelerated fashion (2 Gy,fraction, 6 fractions,week) with concurrent chemotherapy. Interim responses will be assessed using PERCIST criteria. Despite concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, local,regional failure occurs in ~50% of patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Clinical studies have demonstrated that accelerated fractionation (giving the same total dose in a shorter period of time) improves outcomes in several malignancies, including lung cancer. Administering higher than conventional doses of RT to all sites of original disease leads to inferior outcomes. Adapting the RT approach, giving a higher dose to slowly responding disease as assessed with interim PET has been shown to be feasible. PERCIST (Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors) provides guidelines on how to report responses to therapy based on PET CT. PET CT response has been shown to be prognostic in a variety of clinical scenarios in lung cancer including after induction therapy.

The current recommendations are now to administer a carboplatin based bitherapy (4 or 6 cycles). After the treatment is stopped until progression and initiation of a second line treatment. The risk of this strategy is to be confronted to a rapid disease progression during the free interval. Indeed, about 1,3 of the patients whose disease was controlled after the chemotherapy do not receive 2nd line. The concept of maintenance is based on a continuous therapeutic pressure in order to preserve the therapeutic profit obtained by the treatment of 1st line (induction chemotherapy). There is two types of maintenance : continuous maintenance therapy which consists in continuing the treatment initially associated with platinum until disease progression.. switch maintenance which consists in introducing a new treatment after the end of induction chemotherapy The two types are validated by several trials. The marketing authorization of pemetrexed was enlarged to maintenance for non squamous carcinoma. Gemcitabine has a good tolerance profile which make possible the use in a maintenance strategy.

NCT00738452,Radiolabeled Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer After Completion of Radiation Therapy Alone or Combined Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy,"RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and carry tumor killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy together before radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy when given after radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stages I IIIB non small cell lung cancer.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

NCT00298415,Chemotherapy of Elderly Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"The last ASCO recommendations in 2003 for the treatment of a CBNPC of stage IIIB,IV of elderly people, are to manage a monochemotherapy. Paclitaxel in association with carboplatin is feasible in elderly patients and the retrospective analysis of two studies of the comparing SWOG, one this association with that of cisplatine and vinorelbine and the other cisplatine only with cisplatine and vinorelbine, showed among 117 the 70 years old patients and more, the absence of significant difference of survival and toxicity compared to the younger patients. The study recently published of Lilenbaum and Al shows that among patients with bad PS, association carboplatine and paclitaxel do better than the paclitaxel only. The paclitaxel managed in weekly form is likely of a better activity by exposing the cancerous cells in a repeated way with shorter intervals without allowing the emergence of resistant clones and by allowing an increase in the intensity of amount. This mode of administration appeared at the same time effective and tolerated very well among patients of more than 70 years. The weekly association of carboplatin and paclitaxel was tested in phase II and showed a rate of response of 14% and one survival 1 year from 31% a randomized test (not dedicated to the old person) of phase II to 3 arms was led by Belani et al.. The best combination of carboplatine + paclitaxel weekly proved to be that associating paclitaxel 100mg,m² 3 weeks out of 4 and carboplatine AUC 6 in J1 with J1 = J29.

NCT02492867,A Pilot Study of Response Driven Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Successful treatment of lung cancer with radiation therapy requires that the physicians determine exactly where the tumor is in the patient\s body and seek to limit any unnecessary radiation to normal parts of the body. This study is designed to apply functional imaging, Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) (a PET scan) and Ventilation,Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (V,Q SPECT) (a perfusion scan), before treatment and then again during treatment to see if this scanning helps predict how well the treatment works and how well the lung functions during treatment. FDG PET is a modern technology that uses small amounts of a radioactive glucose (FDG) to make images of the whole body and areas of active cancer. V,Q SPECT is an image mapping tool that helps assess how well the lungs are working. A Computerized Tomography (CT) will also be performed along with both of these procedures to help the researchers see clearly where the cancer or the healthy lung is located. The researchers are also doing blood and urine tests in this study to look for markers to see if this helps them determine the patient\s risk of developing side effects from radiation to the lungs. The researchers hope by using these types of tests that they can have more information to help decrease the amount of toxicity patients have from this type of treatment. The researchers hope that this study will help them in the future to design radiation treatment plans that provide the best treatment for each individual patient.","This is a pilot study to improve local tumor control while maintaining the same rate of treatment toxicity by adapting therapy to the uninvolved lung and esophagus while continuing to adapt therapy to the tumor for patients with Stage II,III NSCLC. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and worldwide. In 2012, there were 226,160 new cases and 160,340 deaths related to lung cancer in the United States. Approximately, 80 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC (Non small Cell Lung Cancer), and 40% of these are locally advanced (stage II,III) at diagnosis. The current standard of care for these patients is one size fits all RT (Radiation Therapy) with concurrent chemotherapy in uniform regimens. Even after concurrent chemoradiation, however, the five year overall survival was still about 15%; almost one half of the patients failed locally. At the same time, intensification of both radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy may result in excessive toxicity or incomplete treatment. Therefore, it is critical to tailor the treatment to each individual\s sensitivity in combination with functional imaging guided response driven treatment and biomarker guided individualized dose prescription, thus taking into consideration both the tumor and toxicity profile. Evidence suggests that high dose radiation has the potential to improve local regional control and overall survival in patients treated with fractionated therapy with concurrent chemotherapy. However, it is challenging to deliver high dose RT in the majority of patients with locally advanced NSCLC without exceeding doses to organs at risk and causing significant side effects. Investigators hypothesized that they could develop safer and more effective therapy by adapting treatment to the individual patient\s response. With respect to the tumor, investigators hypothesized, that they could improve outcome by redistributing dose to the more aggressive regions of the tumor, assessed using mid treatment FDG PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanning. With respect to uninvolved organs, investigators need methods of estimating tolerable radiation doses for the individual patient rather than the population average. Such a strategy requires assessing both global and regional normal lung function and the technology to deliver dose in a manner that minimizes damage to functional lung and esophagus. During RT FDG PET,CT potentially can provide important benefits to individual patients by intensifying dose to more resistent tumor, allowing early changes to alternative, more efficacious treatment or by avoiding the unnecessary toxicity related to ineffective therapy. Patients will also undergo a during treatment V,Q SPECT (Single photon Emission Computed Tomography) scan, as an adaptive plan based on during treatment SPECT may further optimize PART (Personalized Adaptive Radiotherapy) to avoid high dose radiation to the well functioning regions, and would thus decrease RILT (Radiation Induced Lung Toxicity). The combination of pre and during V,Q SPECT can classify the lung into different functional regions, and a strategy to give differential priority to the regions has been developed to minimize lung damage. Investigators plan to continue to collect data on serum biomarkers to further refine their biophysical model with the ultimate goal of individualizing radiation dose prescription. By identifying high risk patients and adjusting OAR (Organs at Risk) dose limits to the threshold of tolerance, investigators anticipate a significant reduction in the incidence of toxicity from UMCC 2007.123 (NCT01190527) without compromised tumor control by applying the model to optimize radiation planning.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,"6 weeks (30 treatments, 5 days per week), Up to 24 months, Up to 3 months, 6 weeks (30 treatments, 5 days per week)",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung","Response driven Adaptive Radiation Therapy, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, FDG PET, V,Q SPECT, Durvalumab"

NCT00028938,Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy With or Without Epoetin Alfa in Treating Patients With Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to damage tumor cells. Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and prevent or treat anemia in patients who are undergoing radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It is not yet known if chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy is more effective with or without epoetin alfa in treating non small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy with or without epoetin alfa in treating patients who have stage IIIA or stage IIIB non small cell lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Determine the efficacy of epoetin alfa in maintaining hemoglobin levels in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non small cell lung cancer when treated with chemoradiotherapy.. Compare the time to local and systemic progression in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy with or without epoetin alfa.. Compare tumor response rate and overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.. Compare quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.. Compare the number of transfusions in patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status (90 100% vs 60 80%), weight loss (no more than 5% vs 6 10%), and baseline hemoglobin (women 11.0 12.4 g,dL and men 11.0 13.4 g,dL vs women 12.5 15.0 g,dL and men 13.5 15.0 g,dL). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Beginning 7 10 days before the start of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks. Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks for a total of 33 treatments. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemoradiotherapy, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

NCT03351361,Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Versus Chimiotherapy in First Line Treatment in PS 2 or Elderly in Advanced NSCLC Patients,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the leading cause of cancer related deaths in Western countries. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients already have metastatic disease and a systemic, palliative treatment is the primary therapeutic option. Guidelines for PS 2 patients or older than 75 years old patients at the time of diagnosis recommend for fit patients a carboplatin doublet chemotherapy. Nivolumab has proven efficacy in 3rd line squamous cell lung carcinoma and is superior to chemotherapy in 2nd line treatment of squamous and non squamous lung cancer in term of overall survival. In 1st line, nivolumab failed to show superiority compared to a platin based doublet in terms of progression free survival and overall survival in tumors ≥ 5% PD L1 expression. The association Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab showed encouraging results in first line setting in phase 1 study.

However, this subgroup is heterogeneous, with lymph nodes that are only microscopically invaded to those that are radiologically visible with bulky ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement. Surgical resection in selected patients results in 5 year survival rates of 7 24%. The standard treatment for locally advanced clinical N2 disease is definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy (± radiation) followed by operation. However, in some patients, N2 status could be confirmed only after curative operation without any evidence of N2 diseases through preoperative evaluation methods (CT, PET, mediastinoscopy). We usually define those N2 disease found only after curative operation as microscopic N2, and do adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, little data about the adjuvant therapy for completely resected N2 disease have been available, Hence, we propose a randomized phase II study of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in completely resected microscopic N2 NSCLC.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Microscopic N2 Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Cisplatin",36 months,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"concurrent chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy only"

NCT01404260,Intercalating and Maintenance Use of Iressa Versus Chemotherapy in Selected Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Platinum based combination chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine carboplatin, is one of the standard first line therapy for advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) have clinical efficacy, as compared with the best supportive care or standard chemotherapy, when given as second line or third line therapy for advanced NSCLC. Treatment with EGFR TKI is most effective in female, never smoker, or patients with adenocarcinoma, and patients of Asian origin. In these populations, such treatment is associated with favorable objective response rates, progression free survival, and overall survival. These populations also have a relatively high incidence of somatic mutations in the region of the EGFR gene that encodes the tyrosine kinase domain. The recent study(IPASS) by Tony S. Mok showed gefitinib was superior to carboplatin paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia . In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the EGFR gene mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin paclitaxel(HR= 0.48,P<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin paclitaxel(HR=2.85,P<0.001). Gefitinib treatment was well tolerated, with lower in hematologic toxicity, and no treatment related interstitial lung disease.In this study(IPASS), only patients with a mutation of the EGFR gene in the tumor could get benefit from gefitinib as first line treatment. Tony S. Mok and his colleague also found that intercalating and maintenance administration of erlotinib(another EGFR TKI)following gemcitabine,platinum chemotherapy as first line therapy led to a significant improvement in PFS .","Nowadays,EGFR mutation status is unknown for most of the advanced NSCLC patients in clinical practice.Those patients with high probability of EGFR mutation maybe could get benefit from gefitinib as first line treatment. For this reason, the investigators need more investigation to focus on EGFR mutation unknown patients. In the previous study (including FAST ACT), the patients enrolled trial received EGFR TKI plus chemotherapy nearly simultaneously,so the investigators could not know whether those patients gained benefit from EGFR TKI or chemotherapy, maybe chemotherapy alone was enough. If the patients with EGFR mutation status unknown could get stable disease(SD) after two cycles of chemotherapy,those patients may be optimal for the investigation of intercalating and maintenance administration of gefitinib. The reasons are that chemotherapy may be enough for those with objective response after two cycles chemotherapy, of course, those with disease progression (PD) should be excluded from the study. On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that in a selected population,first line chemotherapy(gemcitabine +carboplatin) with intercalating and maintenance use of gefitinib would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this study, the investigators compared the efficacy, safety, and adverse event profile of chemotherapy plus gefitinib with those of chemotherapy alone, when these drugs were used as first line treatment in nonsmokers or former light smokers in China, who had lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR gene mutation unknown.",Completed,All,18 Years,75 Years,"chemotherapy, maintenance therapy, gefitinib","The evaluation of disease is demanded every two months for the patients receiving maintenance use of Gefitinib or patients in observation after chemotherapy,until disease progression occured",Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"Gefitinib, Gemcitabine +Carboplatin"

NCT02273713,The Addition of Nab paclitaxel (Abraxane) to First Line Treatment of Metastasized Oesophagogastric Carcinoma (ACTION),"Oesophagogastric cancer is a major cause of cancer related mortality, with an overall 5 year survival rate of 10% worldwide and patients are often diagnosed with locally advanced or metastasized disease at first presentation. For advanced oesophagogastric cancer fluoropyrimidines are the backbone of palliative chemotherapy and is commonly used in 2 or 3 drug combinations . However, in clinical practice after progression on first line therapy, a substantial number of oesophagogastric cancer patients may not be able to start second line chemotherapy due to rapid clinical deterioration. Therefore, new triplets with high anti tumor activity and low toxicity are urgently needed. Given the activity of capecitabine and oxaliplatin containing regimens and the potential of taxanes in oesophagogastric cancer, the investigators propose a phase I study combining capecitabine and oxaliplatin with Nab paclitaxel. Solvent based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) can cause severe toxicities not only by the active agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab paclitaxel (Abraxane) is a solvent free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent mediated hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration. It has proven activity in breast cancer, non small lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, as well as in gastric cancer models.","Phase 1: To assess the safety and tolerability of Nab paclitaxel added to oxaliplatin and capecitabine at their currently optimal doses.

NCT01836575,Alimta® Versus Its Combination With Carboplatin in Advanced Non small cell Lung Cancer in Patients Performance Status 2,"Optimal management of patients with advanced NSCLC and with PS 2 remains controversial and underrepresented in clinical trials, typically accounting for 5 to 10% of enrolled patients. Patient PS 2 proportion in population based studies is considerably higher than that included in clinical trials. Management of patients with PS of 2 in clinical practice is empirical and inconsistent. Patients have median overall survival of 3 to 5 months in randomized trials, and treatment options include best supportive care, single agent and combination chemotherapy. Retrospective studies have suggested that patients PS 2 may benefit from first line chemotherapy in terms of symptom improvement and overall survival. In many of these studies, single agent chemotherapy was compared with best supportive care alone. Data on the role of cisplatin based combinations for patients with PS 2 is more scant, with one study questioning its benefit, and another interrupting accrual because of undue toxicity. With regards to carboplatin, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 9730 compared paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel alone in a subgroup of 107 patients with PS 2; the median overall survival was significantly longer in group treated with combination chemotherapy (4.7 versus 2.4 months). Combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel also produced a statistically significantly higher incidence of severe hematological and non hematological toxicities. On the basis of aforementioned results, a recent European panel stated that carboplatin based or low dose cisplatin based doublets might represent alternative options to single agent chemoterapy in patients PS 2. Outside clinical trials, single agent chemotherapy with a 3rd generation agent remains valid option for patients PS2. Results demonstrate that pemetrexed is an agent with established single agent activity in NSCLC, and suggest it is a potential candidate for combinations with platinum and other agents currently utilized for patients with advanced NSCLC. Favorable toxicity profile of pemetrexed suggests that this agent is an ideal candidate for single agent testing and in combination among patients with PS 2. Substantial doubt remains in the comparative benefit from monotherapy versus combination. Starting dose and schedule of pemetrexed were set for this study based on its current labeling in the 2nd line treatment of metastatic NSCLC and 1st line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.","This is a Phase III, open label, randomized study to enroll 228 patients with advanced in a 1:1 ratio at the time of registration. Patients in Arm A will receive pemetrexed, 500 mg,m2, with appropriate vitamin supplementation; patients in Arm B will receive the same dose and schedule of pemetrexed as in Arm A, in combination with carboplatin, AUC of 5. For the purpose of the study, treatment (Arm A or Arm B) will consist of up to four cycles of therapy (repeated every 21 days). Primary endpoint of the study is overall survival; secondary endpoints include toxicity, response rate, and progression free survival. At the time of analysis, patients will be stratified according to age (≥ 70 versus < 70 years), disease stage (IIIB versus IV), site, and weight loss (≥ 5 Kg versus < 5 Kg). The dose of carboplatin will be determined according to the formula developed by Calvert et al., which is shown in equation 1 below and uses the estimated creatinine clearance according to the method of Cockcroft and Gault for estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (equation 2 below): Dose of carboplatin (mg) = Target AUC x (GFR + 25). GFR = (140  Age) x Weight,(72 x serum creatinine) (multiply by 0.85 in women) Sample Size and Expected Accrual In the CALGB 9730 study of advanced NSCLC, first line treatment with paclitaxel plus carboplatin resulted in a median overall survival of 4.7 months among patients with a performance status of 2. In the ECOG 1594 study, the median overall survival of patients with a performance status of 2 who were treated with platinum based doublets was 4.1 months. Approximately 208 eligible patients are needed to provide 80% power to detect a difference between the two treatment arms with a two sided type I error of 0.05, assuming that pemetrexed plus carboplatin will result in a median survival of at least 4.3 months, and pemetrexed alone 2.9 months. An additional 20 patients will be accrued to account for an early dropout rate of 10%, for a total of 228 patients. It is anticipated that the accrual time will be approximately 22 months and patients will be followed for 1 year after completion of treatment; therefore, 2 years and 10 months will be needed to complete the study.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Advanced NSCLC, PS2, Pemetrexed, First line, non squamous",From ICF signature date until e until death date for any cause,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,"Pemetrexed, Carboplatin"

In this trial, the standard chemotherapy is being combined with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is an antibody which works differently from the way other chemotherapy drugs work. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors by binding to a substance found on cancer cells called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor).

NCT01209520,Residual Hypermethylation in Early Stage Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) As Part of Adjuvant Therapy and Preventive Strategy,"The trial investigates the feasibility and efficacy of targeting Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) driven by epigenetic changes. The investigators study the impact of 5 azacitidine (Vidaza®, Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA) in combination with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in a sequential fashion. The study population consists of all NSCLC patients who undergo curative lung cancer resection and whose tumors harbor hypermethylation in any of the protocol specific genes (samples will be banked for additional molecular testing including other 21 loci which have shown to be important in lung carcinogenesis.","Adjuvant chemotherapy has become an essential part for the treatment of stage IB IIIA NSCLC patients based on 4 randomized clinical trials showing survival advantage for patients who received adjuvant CT, oncologists initially started to adapt this modality of treatment for pathologically stage IB IIIA NSCLC patients 4. Herein, NSCLC patients will be treated in the adjuvant setting with conventional doublet platinum based chemotherapy followed by 5 azacitidine, a demethylating agent. The planned dosages to be used in this trial have been extensively studied in previously conducted clinical trials involving all therapeutic agents. All patients will undergo thorough surgical resection of the primary lung tumor, and evidence of promoter hypermethylation of gene(s) must be present in the tumor specimen and,or blood sample (plasma or WBC). The collection of tumor specimen will be considered a priority to correlate the tumor methylation pattern,profile with the serum methylation pattern,profile. If tumor specimen is not available for any reason, but the patient has at least one of the 9 targeted genes hypermethylated in the serum, the patient is eligible to be enrolled into the trial. Treatment will consist of 2 parts: Part A. Adjuvant chemotherapy. Following surgical resection of NSCLC and test positive for promoter hypermethylation in at least one (1) of the targeted TSGs described, patient will start adjuvant conventional chemotherapy (doublet platinum based chemotherapy) for stage IB IIIA NSCLC. In the case a patient with stage IB refuses adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient still can be enrolled into Part B of the study if he,she understands the concept of the trial and sign an informed consent. Conventional chemotherapy will be selected at discretion of the treating physicians except on those cases in which pathologic diagnosis indicates non squamous NSCLC. Those patients will be treated with pemetrexed. Patients will receive a total of 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (each cycle given every 21 days). Pegfilgrastim, a granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF), will be allowed on day 2 at discretion of the clinician. All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel or docetaxel administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). Such premedication may consist of: dexamethasone 20 mg orally administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel or docetaxel; diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) intravenously 30 minutes before paclitaxel. In case of pemetrexed, patient will received an injection of vitamin B 12 1,000 mcg IM a week prior to start therapy as well as folic acid 1 mg po daily a week before pemetrexed infusion and during the entire course of treatment with this antifolate agent. The dosages and toxicities of these chemotherapy agents are very well described in the clinical setting, and patients will be managed as any other patient receiving standard chemotherapy. Part B. Targeted therapy using 5 azacitidine. If the patient decides not to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient still can be enrolled into the study, if the patient understands the concept of chemoprevention and consents to blood sampling during 5 azacitidine administration and follow up (informed consent signed). This part of the study consists of 6 cycles of 5 azacitidine (Vidaza®, Celgene, Summit, NJ, USA). Four weeks after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (day 28 from day 1 of last cycle of chemotherapy), the patient will continue his,her treatment plan with 6 cycles of 5 azacitidine. To be eligible for this part of the study, patient must have no evidence of disease (NED). Thus, patient will be assessed by CT scan chest,abdomen,pelvis with and without intravenous contrast prior to initiating Part B. In case of iodine allergy,anaphylaxis history, patient will be assessed with MRI. Progression of disease will be defined by RECIST criteria. Patient will receive 5 azacitidine at a dose of 75 mg,m2 intravenously daily on day 1 5 every 28 days for 6 cycles. Biological correlatives will be performed during this period. Toxicity management is described in section 6.0. The use of growth factor support (either erythropoietin stimulating agents or G CSF) will be also allowed at discretion of the treating physician. Anatomical Studies: All patients will have surgical resection of the primary tumor. Pieces of the resected tumor and non tumor lung tissues that are not required for pathological evaluation will be frozen in optimum temperature compound (OTC) and saved for molecular analysis. As part of the enrollment process, patient will be assessed through CT scan of the chest,abdomen,pelvis with and without intravenous contrast or with MRI in case of contraindication for iodine contrast, prior to initiate Part B of the treatment (confirming clinically and radiological no evidence of disease NED). Another assessment will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of 5 azacitidine (to confirm NED status). Patient will be clinically followed up every 3 months until completion of 2 years post treatment. Imaging tests will be performed every 3 months with CT scan as part of the standard follow up until completion of 2 years post surgery. After 2 years of post treatment completion, patient will be followed up every 6 months in the clinic and also by radiographic studies until completion of 5 years post treatment. In the case of clinical suspicion for progression, patient will undergo a thorough and complete work up to rule out this possibility. This may include imaging diagnostic tests, biopsy, or other tests and procedures. Biological Correlatives: The premise of the study is that certain loci will be hypermethylated in the lung cancer specimen of the patients. For some loci (which we shall call Type I) the tumor will show significantly elevated methylation compared to adjacent histologically normal tissue, thus providing a cancer specific methylation signal. Other loci (which we will refer to as Type II) may be methylated in the tumor as well as in the adjacent histologically normal tissue and,or WBCs. These loci will not be cancer specific markers, though they may indicate precancerous changes or they may be indicative of cancer risk. Their hypermethylation may be age associated or environmentally induced, yielding field effects or field defects. Field defects would consist of molecular alterations (in this case hypermethylation) that are not yet visible as histological changes. Independent of whether a hypermethylated locus is specific for overt cancer (Type I) or not (Type II), it would be of interest for the study. These Type II changes would be hypothesis generating. Since it has been well documented in the literature that DNA from cells can be shed into the blood stream (more so in the case of cancer patients), it would be expected that at least for some of the loci that are hypermethylated (Type I and II), this methylation would be detectable in the plasma. Tumor tissue methylation will be correlated with serum obtained at the time of tumor resection. It might be expected that complete resection would lead to a reduction or complete disappearance in the methylation signal for Type I loci in the plasma, since the source of the signal has been removed. Type II also shows methylation in the tissue adjacent to the tumor, these loci might continue to provide signal in the plasma (though it may be somewhat diminished). Type I loci would therefore be of great use to verify complete resection and to monitor recurrence (one would anticipate the signal to increase again as the cancer grows back), while Type II loci would be a great tool to monitor the efficacy of demethylating drugs. It must be acknowledged that the spectrum of Type I and Type II methylation may not be sharply delineated.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Lung Cancer, Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, NSCLC, Methylation Analysis, Hypermethylation, Targeted Genes, Tumorigenesis, Tumor Supressor Genes","Up to 2 years, Up to 2 years",Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Lung Cancer, Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Hypermethylation","Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, Vidaza, Tumor Specimen for Methylation Analysis, Blood Sample for Methylation Analysis, Vinorelbine, Docetaxel, Pemetrexed"

NCT02426281,Nab pacliatxel Plus Gemcitabine in Korean Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Nab paclitaxel (interchangeable with ABRAXANE and ABI 007) is a unique protein formulation of a noncrystalline, amorphous form of paclitaxel in an insoluble particle state. Nab paclitaxel was designed to improve the chemotherapeutic effects of paclitaxel by exploiting endogenous transport pathways to deliver higher doses of paclitaxel to the tumor and to reduce the solvent related hypersensitivity and other toxicities associated with Taxol® (paclitaxel) injections, the solvent Cremophor EL, and ethanol vehicle. Nab paclitaxel provides more rapid tissue distribution and increased tumor accumulation compared to cremophor EL paclitaxel. Mechanistically, albumin receptor mediated transport across the endothelium, binding to interstitial proteins, and macropinocytic or receptor mediated uptake into tumor cells as well as sequestration of paclitaxel by cremophor EL may contribute to the observed differences. Furthermore, nab paclitaxel synergizes with gemcitabine in preclinical models. The Cremophor EL free medium enables nab paclitaxel to be given at a higher dose and in a shorter duration without the need for premedication to prevent solvent related hypersensitivity reactions. As of March 2014, nab paclitaxel is approved under the trade name of ABRAXANE in over 45 countries,regions, including the US, Canada, India, European Union,European Economic Area, South Korea, China, Australia, Bhutan, United Arab Emirates, Nepal, New Zealand, Japan, Russia, Sri Lanka, Argentina, Hong Kong, and Lebanon for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. ABRAXANE is also approved for the first line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the US, Japan, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand, for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in Japan, and for first line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the US, EU,EEA, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina.","Preclinical studies have demonstrated that nab paclitaxel may play a role in sensitizing the tumor to chemotherapeutic agents and specifically increases the antitumor efficacy when combined with gemcitabine. While the mechanism of action for the synergy is unclear, preclinical studies have generated hypothetical models. One hypothesis is a remodeling and weakening of the stroma barrier, allowing the chemotherapeutic agents to have better access to the tumor cells. Weakening the tumor stroma barrier is particularly important in cancer that is characterized by dense stroma, such as pancreatic cancer. In mice with primary patient derived pancreatic tumor xenografts, nab paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone resulted in increased tumor regression and depleted the desmoplastic stroma as observed by the less dense, disorganized, wisps of collagen type1 fibers after 4 weeks of treatment. In this study, the intratumoral concentration of gemcitabine was increased by 2.8 fold after 5 days of treatment when nab paclitaxel was added to gemcitabine. It was hypothesized that nab paclitaxel may play a role in reducing the dense stroma and may have contributed to the increased intratumoral gemcitabine uptake. Additional preclinical studies in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, coadministration of nab paclitaxel and gemcitabine also demonstrated tumor regression and increased intratumoral gemcitabine levels after 8 days of treatment. Apoptosis of tumor epithelial cells were observed; however, there were no changes in stromal components or collagen density in this short term treatment model. The increased intratumoral gemcitabine levels were attributed to a marked decrease in the primary gemcitabine metabolizing enzyme, cytidine deaminase, by nab paclitaxel. Finally, a recent clinical study in subjects with resectable pancreatic cancer treated with neoadjuvant nab paclitaxel plus gemcitabine showed reduction in fibrotic collagenous stroma, further supporting a stroma active mechanism for nab paclitaxel. In a clinical Phase 1,2 dose ranging study (CA040, NCT003980860), nab paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (CA040, NCT003980860) antitumor activity and tolerability were established in patients who had no prior treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for further studies was determined to be 125 mg,m2 nab paclitaxel in combination with 1000 mg,m2 gemcitabine. In the subsequent randomized international Phase 3 study (MPACT, CA046, NCT00394251) that enrolled 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, nab paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine exhibited a clinically meaningful, statistically significant improvement in OS and progression free survival (PFS). The median OS (primary endpoint) in the intent to treat population was 8.5 months (95% CI = 7.89 9.53) with nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine compared with 6.7 months (95 % CI = 6.01 7.23) with gemcitabine, p < 0.0001, HR = 0.72 (95% CI = 0.617 0.835). Long term survival was improved in the nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine arm versus gemcitabine alone, with a 59% increase at 1 year (35% versus 22%) and doubling at 2 years (9% versus 4%). The secondary (PFS, overall response rate ORR) and all other efficacy endpoints showed consistent, statistically significant improvements with nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine, supporting the results from the primary analysis of OS. Specifically, PFS (by independent review) was 5.5 months (95% CI = 4.47 5.95) versus 3.7 months (95% CI = 3.61 4.04) in the nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine arm versus gemcitabine alone arms, respectively p < 0.0001; HR =0 .69; 95% CI = 0.581 0.821). The improvement in PFS corresponded to a 31% reduction in the risk of progression or death with nab paclitaxel,gemcitabine. Furthermore, in this study of metastatic unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, subjects in the combination arm were on therapy longer than those receiving single agent gemcitabine, indicating disease improvement and tolerable treatment. The suitability of the dosing regimen was confirmed by the observation that the majority of patients did not require a dose reduction, and that 71% of nab paclitaxel doses were delivered at the starting dose of 125 mg,m2. The safety profile for both regimens was consistent with previous reports. Serious life threatening toxicities were not increased; AEs were acceptable and manageable. The most notable differences in toxicity between the 2 treatment arms was peripheral neuropathy, which was cumulative and rapidly reversible with dose delay and reduction, and neutropenia, which was manageable with dose delays and dose reductions. The incremental risks of sepsis and pneumonitis were managed by protocol amendments to increase awareness, and for early diagnosis and treatment to reduce the risk of fatal outcomes. Since the above described initial analysis of the MPACT study, the updated OS with a cutoff of May 2013 showed that the benefit continued to improve with nab paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, with 8.7 versus 6.6 median months, respectively. The updated survival rates also significantly favored nab paclitaxel plus gemcitabine at year 1 (35% versus 22%), year 2 (10% versus 5%), and year 3 (4% versus 0%) as compared with gemcitabine alone.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,4 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"nab paclitaxel, gemcitabine"

NCT00101920,ABX EGF as Second Line Treatment of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor types, suggesting a self propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth. Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX EGF, a fully human monoclonal antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors. Purpose: This is a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABX EGF in the treatment of advanced NSCLC following failure of paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy on treatment arm 1 of Immunex Protocol 054.0004 (Amgen Protocol 20025404), Part 2.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,,End of initial 6 week treatment period,Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Neoplasm Metastasis, Lung Cancer",ABX EGF
NCT00667147,Phase I Abraxane Weekly and Three Weekly Schedule With Vandetanib,"This study uses the drugs Abraxane (also called ABI 007) and Vandetanib (also called Zactima and ZD6474). Abraxane has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the treatment of breast cancer. Vandetanib is an experimental drug and has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of any condition. Vandetanib has shrunk some non small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and thyroid cancer in some studies in humans. This combination of drugs is not approved for the treatment of any condition by the FDA. This study is being done in two phases. The first phase of the trial has two main objectives: 1) To find the highest daily dose of vandetanib that can be given safely with once weekly Abraxane and 2) To find the highest daily dose of vandetanib that can be given safely with Abraxane given every three weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive Abraxane weekly (Arm A) or once every three weeks (Arm B). The dose of Abraxane given will remain the same for the whole study  100 mg,m2 when given weekly and 260 mg,m2 when given every three weeks. Participants will be entered onto each arm of the study in groups of three, and higher doses of vandetanib will be given each group of participants. The increase of vandetanib will stop once more than one participant has serious side effects. The highest dose of vandetanib that can be given with Abraxane (without serious side effects) in each Arm will be called the pilot dose. In the second phase of the study twenty participants will be randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B and receive the pilot dose of vandetanib that was reached in the first phase of the study. The purpose of the second phase of the study is to see how many tumors shrink when participants receive the pilot dose of the drug combination on each Arm, as well as to gather more information about the side effects.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,,First Cycle of Study Therapy,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Solid Tumors,"Weekly Abraxane and Daily Vandetanib, Abraxane every three weeks and daily vandetanib"

NCT02805530,Radical Treatment of Synchronous Oligometastatic Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent neoplasm worldwide and also represents the main cause of cancer death. However, it represents the main cause of death by cancer. The prognosis of survival at 5 years is poor, approximately 13 15%. Various studies suggest that patients who clinically present with a limited number of metastases, a term defined as oligometastatic disease, could have a better prognosis of survival with a radical treatment, than for their counterparts with a greater number of metastasis. The purpose of this study is to add more information to the current medical literature about the benefits in overall survival of radical treatment of oligometastatic disease in patients with NSCLC and equal or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis. The outcomes of the study are to determine the global survival and progression free survival in patients with synchronous oligometastatic (equal to or less than 5 sites) advanced NSCLC undergoing radical treatment of all metastatic sites and the primary tumor.","Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent neoplasm worldwide and also represents the main cause of cancer death. However, it represents the main cause of death by cancer. The prognosis of survival at 5 years is poor, approximately 13 15%. The timely detection of NSCLC is difficult and the options for curative treatment are limited since the majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stages. The standard treatment in metastatic disease is cytotoxic chemotherapy with platins (cisplatin or carboplatin) in combination with a third generation drug (vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine or pemetrexed). This therapeutic scheme results in response rates between 20 30%, with a mean overall survival between 8 11 months. In recent years, research in oncology has focused on the development of therapies aimed at molecular targets that control the growth and proliferation of the tumor cell. Various monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, cetuximab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, crizotinib) have been evaluated with this purpose in NSCLC treatment. Clinical studies in advanced NSCLC, using these new drugs with or without chemotherapy, have had favorable results by increasing the progression free survival and the response rate, without being able to demonstrate to date, a significant improvement in the overall survival. Various studies suggest that patients who clinically present with a limited number of metastases, a term defined as oligometastatic disease, could have a better prognosis of survival with a radical treatment, than for their counterparts with a greater number of metastasis. Much of the current medical information on clinical outcomes in oligometastatic disease is based on clinical studies and retrospective case series of institutions. The majority of the reports have included a mix of patients with synchronous and metachronous oligometastatic disease, focusing on the radical treatment of specific sites such as the brain and adrenal glands. These results have been recognized by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and have been included in its treatment guidelines for lung cancer (2012). The recommendation states to consider some radical treatment in selected patients with solitary metastases. There is limited information about the clinical benefits in overall survival in the subgroup of patients with NSCLC that clinically present with synchronous oligometastatic disease and equal to or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to add more information to the current medical literature about the benefits in overall survival of radical treatment of oligometastatic disease in patients with NSCLC and equal to or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis.

NCT02716311,Combination of Cetuximab With Afatinib for Patient With EGFR Mutated Lung Cancer,"Until recently, the first line treatment of metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) was a platine based chemotherapy. It has been changed by the discovery of EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) mutations and associated treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) of EGFR. The superiority of EGFR TKI over chemotherapy for EGFR mutated patients has been proved in several phase III trials with gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib. Nevertheless, all patients will progress after 9 to 12 months of treatment due to the appearance of a treatment resistance. Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR TKI. It binds to its receptor permanently.Contrary to erlotinib and gefitinb which inhibits only EGFR, afatinib inhibits the kinase activity of all HER family (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor). Nevertheless, there is no proof that afatinib delay the appearance of resistance. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody which binds specifically with EGFR. The double inhibition of EGFR by afatinib and cetuximab has demonstrated its efficacy in pre clinical models.

NCT01415011,Efficacy and Safety Study of Afatinib to Treat Lung Cancer Patients,The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of using afatinib (BIBW 2992) to treat non small cell lung cancer patients considered unfit for chemotherapy and have either suspected or confirmed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation.,"Lung cancer is most common cause of death from cancer, of which non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~80% of all cases with most patients presenting with advanced disease. Patients medically unfit to receive radical or platinum doublet palliative systemic therapy, because of poor performance status or comorbidity, account for at least 45% of newly diagnosed cases and have poor survival. Many oncologists have interpreted single agent chemotherapy data as not clinically meaningful when balanced against toxicities, non significant improvements in quality of life and comorbidity. Hence, in the UK, this group of patients are predominantly treated by best supportive care (BSC). This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of using afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible second generation EGFR inhibitor, in patients with non small cell lung cancer, who are considered unfit for chemotherapy and have either suspected or confirmed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation. Suspected EGFR mutant patients will have clinical characteristics likely to harbour the EGFR mutation (adenocarcinoma sub type and ex or never smokers) with EGFR genotype unknown either due to no tissue suitable for genotyping or failed genotype. There has been only one small prospective study of medically unfit patients with EGFR mutation, but it demonstrated good efficacy with a TKI17. This phase II study of East Asian patients (n=30) with performance status 2 4 and treated with gefitinib demonstrated a rapid improvement in performance status at 1 month, an overall response rate of 66% and median survival of 17.8 months. Whilst gefitinib is licensed for EGFR mutant NSCLC, no prospective studies have yet been performed on medically unfit patients from Western countries. Despite dramatic initial responses, EGFR mutant NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib,erlotinib ultimately relapse. In ~50% of cases this is due to the gefitinib,erlotinib resistant T790M genotype acquired through either secondary somatic mutation or clonal expansion. There is therefore a need to improve the outcomes of medically unfit patients with suspected EGFR mutation, who would otherwise be treated with best supportive care, and in proven EGFR mutation cases by using an effective EGFR directed therapy that inhibits EGFRT790M. Prospective data on medically unfit Western NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation are required to assess the efficacy of EGFR TKIs. Additionally, given that 50% of such patients will become TKI resistant through EGFRT790M, new therapies are required to overcome this resistance mechanism.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Afatinib (BIBW2992), EGFR Mutation, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Poor performance status, Elderly",At 6 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung",Afatinib (BIBW 2992)
NCT01156545,BIBW 2992 Plus Simvastatin vs. BIBW 2992 in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non adenocarcinomatous NSCLC,"The investigators hypothesized that simvastatin may enhance sensitivity to BIBW 2992 in non adenocarcinoma that is relatively resistant to TKIs. Based on these data, the investigators will research the effectiveness comparing BIBW2992, an irreversible EGFR TKI, plus simvastatin with BIBW2992 alone in the setting of a randomized phase II study in previously treated patients with advanced non adenocarcinomatous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","One of the main reasons of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is that there are alternative mechanisms for persistent activating EGFR downstream signaling, including both RAS,Erk and PI3K,Akt kinase pathways. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of both pathways would be necessary to reduce tumor cell survival more effectively. One of the candidate combinations is concurrent use of EGFR TKIs and statins, which are irreversible inhibitors of 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase and have been used to treat hypercholesterolemia through blocking the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. Beside the cholesterol lowering effect, statins have been shown to induce apoptosis in several tumor types. It affects the synthesis of other products of the mevalonate pathway such as isoprenoids, which are used as substrates for prenylation. Attachment of isoprenoids to RAS proteins facilitates their anchoring to the cell membrane where they carried out their roles. By interrupting the biosynthesis of mevalonate, statins inhibit activation of RAS and downstream signaling cascades, including the RAF,MEK,ERK and PI3K,AKT, which play critical roles in regulation of cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, it seems to be a promising therapeutic approach overcoming tumor resistance to EGFR TKIs, which is associated with RAS activation. According to the recent clinical result of phase II trial, a randomized phase II study of gefitinib with or without simvastatin in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC conducted by Han et al.37 gefitinib plus simvastatin combination produced higher response rates than gefitinib alone in patients with non adenocarcinoma (5,13 39% v 1,13 8%, P=0.06). This finding suggests that simvastatin may enhance sensitivity to gefitinib in non adenocarcinoma that is relatively resistant to gefitinib. Moreover, by Mantha et al.35 demonstrated that the combination of gefitinib and lovastatin showed significant synergic cytotoxic effects in vitro in a total of 16 squamous cell carcinomas, NSCLC, and colon carcinoma cell lines. Of special interest, these cell lines did not possess the activating mutations of EGFR, which confer increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Nevertheless, combining lovastatin with gefitinib induced more significant inhibition of AKT activation than either agent alone. Additionally, lovastatin significantly enhanced the sensitivity to gefitinib treatment regardless PTEN loss in glioblastoma cell lines. These results suggest that statins can augment EGFR inhibition.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"BIBW 2992, Simvastatin, NSCLC, advanced stage, previously treated patients, non adenocarcinoma",each 8 weeks,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"BIBW 2992, simvastatin"

All patients had documented EGFR activating mutations before the start of afatinib. Determination of EGFR mutation analysis of all patients was described previously. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor biopsies before starting 1st TKI therapy were retrieved. Briefly, tumor enrichment was performed by micro dissection under light microscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of EGFR exons 18 to 21 using intron based primers and sequenced in both forward and reverse directions. Study population Patients who had EGFR mutated metastatic NSCLC with prior documented objective response to first generation TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) for 6 months and prior treatment of at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy were eligible to join the CUP offered by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany. Patients who had received anti vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist but not anti EGFR monoclonal antibody in their previous courses of treatment, either alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy were allowed to join this CUP. They all had baseline computed tomography scan of the brain, thorax and abdomen with at least 1 evaluable lesion and adequate serum hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined by LUX Lung1 study. Treatment The treating physicians then decided the starting dose of afatinib of either 50 mg, 40 mg or 30 mg once daily continuously. After commencement of afatinib, they had regular clinical follow up every 2 weeks for 4 weeks then every 4 weeks until permanent discontinuation of afatinib or death. They also had regular imaging with CT scan every 8 10 weeks for tumor response evaluation by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 16. Treatment interruption was needed for those who developed grade >= 3 adverse event until it was returned to grade 1 or less. Then afatinib could be resumed but at a one lower dose level. Those who received afatinib 30 mg daily as the initial starting dose would discontinue afatinib permanently if they developed grade >=3 events. Assessment of efficacy and treatment related toxicities All treatment related toxicities were collected and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Objective response (OR) included complete response and partial response while disease control (DC) included complete response, partial response and stable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Survival outcomes included progression free survival (PFS, defined as time from start of afatinib to first of date of objectively determined progressive disease or death from any cause) and overall survival (OS, time from start of afatinib to date of death from any cause). Time to progression (TTP) started from the date of afatinib commencement to the date of objectively determined progressive disease. All these parameters in those who received afatinib in this study were compared to a historical cohort of patients who received erlotinib after prior failure to gefitinib and at least one line of systemic chemotherapy. All patients in the historical cohort received erlotinib at 150 mg once daily, with the same treatment response evaluation, survival and toxicity assessment as for those who received afatinib. Statistical analysis Mann Whitney U was used for comparison of non parametric variables and chi square tests were performed for discrete variables. Kaplan Meier methods with log rank tests were employed for comparison of survival outcomes and Cox proportional hazard models were used for prognostic factors for PFS after afatinib or erlotinib in univariate and multivariate analyses, with afatinib versus erlotinib, age, sex, performance status, smoking status, histology, TTP for 1st TKI therapy, time interval between 1st TKI and afatinib or erlotinib, TTP for all lines of prior chemotherapy, time interval between last chemotherapy and afatinib or erlotinib as covariates.

Some cancer drugs for NSCLC work to block this signal from reaching its target on the cancer cells which in turn may slow or stop the cancer from growing. However, many times patients with EGFR mutations will stop responding to these cancer drugs and develop drug resistance because they have developed a specific EGFR mutation called T790M.

NCT02369484,Afatinib in NSCLC With HER2 Mutation,The purpose of this study is to investigate the control of disease in pretreated patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring HER2 exon 20 mutations as well as the safety and tolerability (how severe the side effects are) of the treatment with afatinib.,"Previous clinical studies of NSCLC have shown that patients with tumors harboring specific gene mutations (changes) in the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) showed better results after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), like afatinib (tradename Giotrif®) , compared with classical treatment with chemotherapy. The treatment with TKI has become a new standard of care for patient with advanced lung cancer and EGFR or ALK changes. Several novel mutations, which are candidates as targets for specific medication have been discovered. Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2, erbB 2,neu) is a protein of the so called ErbB family (including HER2 ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4). These proteins are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Mutations in HER2 are found in about 2% of the NSCLC. Afatinib works by blocking the activity of the ErbB family proteins and can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells. Afatinib is approved by the European and the Swiss Medicines Agencies for the treatment of adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non small cell lung cancer) that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR as first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient. A total of 22 patients from centers around Europe are expected to be enrolled in this study over a period of 24 months. All patients will be treated in the same way.

NCT01783587,Safety Study of Afatinib and Postoperative Radiation Therapy to Treat Head and Neck Cancer,"This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. Investigational means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it such as the safest dose to use and the side effects it may cause. Afatinib has been studied in other clinical trials of participants with head and neck cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. This dose of Afatinib has also been studied in other research studies. This is the first clinical trial to study Afatinib in combination with Radiation Therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of Afatinib when given in combination with Radiation Therapy or in combination with Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. Afatinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug works by blocking multiple proteins known to play a role in the growth of cancer cells. Information from laboratory research studies suggests that this drug may help to make head and neck cancer cells more sensitive to Radiation Therapy. The other therapy in this research study is Radiation Therapy or Radiation Therapy plus a chemotherapy drug called Docetaxel. After surgery, Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy is the standard treatment if you have high risk disease. High risk disease means that without additional therapy, there is a high risk that the disease may return. In this study, participants with high risk disease will receive Radiation Therapy and Docetaxel and Afatinib. Intermediate risk means that there is an intermediate risk that the disease may return. Radiation Therapy alone is the standard treatment approach for intermediate risk cancer. In this study, participants with intermediate risk disease will receive Radiation Therapy and Afatinib.","If you are willing to take part in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not take part in the research study. If you already had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The tests and procedures include: a review of your medical history, physical exam, blood samples, urine sample, serum pregnancy test, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and an assessment of your disease to find out the extent of your cancer. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you may begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study. We will collect an archive tumor specimen (leftover tissue from your prior surgery or biopsies) to confirm your cancer diagnosis. Additional tests on the tumor specimen may be performed as a part of future studies to gain new knowledge about head and neck cancer. You will receive Afatinib as a pill that you take by mouth for 7 weeks. During the first week, you will receive Afatinib alone. During the second through seventh weeks, you will receive Afatinib together with Radiation Therapy OR with Docetaxel and Radiation Therapy. Docetaxel is given intravenously, once a week during Week 2 through Week 7. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how well they tolerated their doses. Afatinib needs to be taken on an empty stomach. Specific instructions about this will be included in the drug diary you will need to complete. If you take part in this research study, you will receive the same radiation that you would receive if you were not on the study. The radiation is typically done daily Monday through Friday for about 6 7 weeks. You will sign a separate consent form with your radiation oncologist that will outline what to expect with this treatment. You will be given a physical exam every week during your treatment. You will have a physical exam and be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking. You will have blood tests every week during your treatment including chemistry and hematology tests and a pregnancy test if you are a woman capable of becoming pregnant before you receive your first infusion of docetaxel. You will also be asked to return to the clinic one week, four weeks and eight weeks after finishing your treatment. Most of these visits are part of routine visits after finishing treatment. If you stop the study early for any reason, you will also have a clinic visit. In either instance, the following exams and procedures will be performed: physical exam, blood tests, other tests including an electrocardiogram, MUGA scan or echocardiogram, CT scan and a PET,CT scan.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,7 weeks,Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck,"Afatinib, Docetaxel, Radiation Therapy"

NCT05204758,Prophylactic TCM for Mitigation of EGFR TKI Related Dermatological Adverse Effect,"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) have become standard practice for advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR gene mutation. EGFR TKIs involving Afatinib, Erlotinib, and Gefitinib were Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved since 2006 and given payment continuously for lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation in Taiwan. Several researches mention the positive correlation between skin toxicities and clinical response, such as improved median survival, overall survival and progression free survival. Nevertheless, quite a few patients reduced dose or discontinued EGFR TKIs because of prolonged or intolerable adverse effects, thus causing disease progress and even death. Based on the experts opinion, some basic strategies have been developed to manage dermatologic adverse effects. Those strategies have the potential to improve patient quality of life and to prevent dose reductions or discontinuation. The concept of prophylaxis in EGFR TKI related adverse effects had existed for rash and diarrhea, but it is not well spread. Although several studies indicate that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) facilitates the treatment of lung cancer, clinical analysis of prophylactic TCM in EGFR TKIs related skin toxicities remains absent. Based on TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment and clinical experiences, the investigators have found effective TCM compositions to relieve these toxicities. Therefore, the investigators develop a pilot, prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled TCM research to prevent EGFR TKIs related dermatological adverse effects. The purpose of this study suggest that TCM could provide synergic effect with EGFR TKIs, which means TCM could reduce and prevent EGFR TKIs related dermatological adverse effects without interfering formulary cancer therapy. The investigators hypothesize that prophylactic TCM with standard of care will delay any grade skin toxicity to 14 days as well as reduce the incidence of grade 3 skin toxicity from 30% to less than 10%. Due to high EGFR mutation rate of lung adenocarcinoma in Taiwan, it is necessary to investigate whether combination of TCM is beneficial to patients of advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR gene mutation.","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, EGFR TKIs have become standard practice for advanced NSCLC with EGFR gene mutation. An epidemiological study in 2012 reported that EGFR mutations from Asian advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients were 22 64% and the rate in Taiwan was 62.1%. Another epidemiological study in 2015 showed that the EGFR mutation rate of treatment naïve lung adenocarcinoma in Taiwan was 55.4%. Depend on several extensive studies, oral treatment of EGFR TKIs improved progression free survival (PFS) about 9.2 13.6% than traditional chemotherapy. EGFR TKIs involving Afatinib, Erlotinib, and Gefitinib were FDA approved since 2006 and given payment continuously for lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation in Taiwan.

NCT04201756,Neoadjuvant Afatinib Therapy for Potentially Resectable Stage III EGFR Mutation Positive Lung Adenocarcinoma,"In general, for patients with stage I or II disease, surgery provides the best chance for cure.EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs)are standard first line treatment for EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC.Afatinib was a 2nd generation EGFR TKI that covalently bound and irreversibly blocked signaling through activated EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and ErbB4 receptors, and the FDA has approved afatinib for first line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations.The treatment of stage III NSCLC remains a matter of debate. Current multimodality treatment options for stage III included definitive chemoradiation, surgery followed by adjuvant therapy,or neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection.Previous studies have revealed that adjuvant EGFR TKI could significantly prolong disease free surivival, and have less toxicity than adjuvant chemotherapy for early resectable EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.EMERGING CTONG1103 regarding neoadjuvant erlotinib vs chemotherapy (Gemcitabine plus cisplatin) for stage III NSCLC reveal that erlotinib has improved ORR (54%), major pathological response, operation rate, R0 resection and lymph node downstaging, and progression free survival (PFS).A phase II trial (ASCENT) of neoadjuvant afatinib for stage III EGFR mutation NSCLC concludes that afatinib yields the highest ORR (75%) up to now and verifies the feasibility of neoadjuvant EGFR TKIs for stage III NSCLC. However, no more studies are available so far to confirm the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant afatinib in the treatment of resectable stage III EGFR mutation positive NSCLC, and there is a lack of studies based on the Chinese population.

NCT02847377,A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging Agent 18F ODS2004436 as a Marker of EGFR Mutation in Subjects With NSCLC,"The development of biomarkers will lead the dynamic of personalized medicine and fill the unsatisfied needs in oncology for prediction of therapeutic response. Molecular imaging enables non invasive quantification of biomarkers. The development of molecular imaging biomarkers is closely related to the development of therapeutic molecules. Among the potential targets, kinases offer a lot of advantages: (i) they play a central role in cellular regulation, (ii) numerous kinase specific small molecule libraries exist in biotech and pharma industry, (iii) several kinase targeted therapies are used in clinic (imatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib…) with application across a variety of therapeutic indications. Among the imaging technologies, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the most sensitive and dedicated to evaluate small molecules. However few radiotracers are available and their specificity limits their clinical use. The IMAkinib® approach is an innovative method proposed to develop new PET radiotracers adapted to current medical and economical challenges. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an established target for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Gefitinib (Iressa®), erlotinib (Tarceva®) and afatinib (Giotrif®) have already been approved for treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations (L858R or del exon 19). Unfortunately the majority of patients will develop a resistance to the TKI in the long term (6 12 months). If the mechanism of resistance is not yet fully characterized, most patients (50%) will acquire an additional T790M mutation of EGFR. TKI PET imaging can provide a tool to determine and predict responsiveness to EGFR TKI in vivo. That is why, the investigators have selected and radiolabeled (18 Fluor) a compound targeting specifically EGFR mutated (18F ODS2004436) which was further evaluated in a preclinical imaging study to determine the feasibility of TKI PET.

This approach also allows for investigations of molecular parameters that may affect response to chemotherapy and patients survival. It is our hypothesis that the expression of genes associated with activation, inactivation, and efficacy of the drugs gemcitabine and pemetrexed will predict response to therapy and prognosis. We further hypothesize that the expression of these genes will be altered during chemotherapy, and that the global assessment of tumor proliferation, apoptosis, and genome damage is associated with response to therapy.

NCT00744900,Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin for Brain Metastasis of Advanced Non  Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"NSCLC patients often have cerebral metastasis : 10% at diagnosis and 40% during disease management. Neurosurgery is not indicated in the majority of cases because of presence of several lesions in the brain, failure of primary tumor control or presence of extra cerebral metastasis. Cerebral metastasis lead to death in 30 to 50% of these cases. Management of these patients in this situation is based on supportive care and whole brain radiotherapy. The place of chemotherapy for patients with good performance status was discussed for a long time and it is now admitted. However, the place of new drugs such as pemetrexed, which is currently used as a second line treatment for NSCLC, needs to be further studied. It is known that pemetrexed when added to cisplatin for treatment of NSCLC provides a similar effectiveness when compared to other drugs associations commonly used in this indication. In addition, Cisplatin with Pemetrexed probably present a better safety profile. The present study is based upon the hypothesis stipulating that the association cisplatin pemetrexed will be at least as efficient as the others association currently used for treatment of NSCLC and will present a better safety profile. The primary objective of this study is overall response rate on brain metastasis according to RECIST criteria. Secondary judgment criterias are : Overall response rate, PFS after first line CDDP plus pemetrexed, safety profile, quality of life, neurological symptoms, overall survival.

NCT00117962,"Pemetrexed Disodium, Carboplatin, and Radiation Therapy With or Without Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Stage III Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","RATIONALE: Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and radiation therapy together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

NCT00389805,Bortezomib and Pemetrexed Disodium in Treating Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer or Other Solid Tumors,"RATIONALE: Bortezomib and pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bortezomib together with pemetrexed disodium may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I,II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of two different schedules of bortezomib when given together with pemetrexed disodium and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors.","OBJECTIVES: Primary Determine the safety, including dose limiting toxicities, and feasibility of combining bortezomib with pemetrexed disodium in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or other solid tumors. (Phase I). Determine the response rate in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with this regimen. (Phase II) Secondary Compare the toxicity of 2 different schedules of bortezomib and pemetrexed disodium in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I). Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib when administered with pemetrexed disodium in 2 different treatment schedules in these patients. (Phase I). Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of the combination of bortezomib and pemetrexed disodium in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I). Assess the overall survival and progression free survival of these patients. (Phase II). Evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this regimen. (Phase II) Tertiary Perform laboratory correlative studies on tumor tissue and blood samples to investigate potential predictors of response. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II, open label study. Phase I: Patients will be accrued, in an alternating fashion, to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Group I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.. Group II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1 and bortezomib IV on days 1 and 8. In both groups, treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3 6 patients per group receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium bortezomib (at the MTD) as in either group I or group II of the phase I portion of the study.

NCT01204307,Influence of Prior Chemotherapy on Clinical Benefit With Erlotinib in Patients With Advanced Non Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer With or Without EGFR Gene Mutation,To compare the differential influence of 1st line doublet chemotherapy containing Docetaxel versus Pemetrexed on clinical efficacy of Erlotinib as a second line therapy in patients with relapsed or progressed non squamous NSCLC.,"The clinical management of advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains challenging. Initial therapies for advanced NSCLC with platinum based regimens have shown consistent overall response rates of 30% to 40% with progression free intervals of 4 5 months and 1 year survival rates of 35% to 40% 1 3. First line doublet chemotherapy commonly used in daily practice includes Gemcitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel and docetaxel those have proven efficacy with platinum against best supportive care, prolonging survival for approximately 3 months. Recently, pemetrexed, a multi target antifolate agent, has been introduced into the 1st line doublet chemotherapy with platinum based regimen to have similar efficacy and a better safety profile compared to docetaxel or gemcitabine 4. Although those agents seem to have equivalent efficacy, tolerability tends to be a concern for docetoxel. Myelosuppression with the standard docetaxel schedule of 75 mg,m2 administered once every 3 weeks is extremely frequent and severe; neutropenia occurs in 54% to 67% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurs in 1.8% to 8.0% of patients 5, 6. Moreover, non hematologic toxicities, such as grade 3 4 asthenia (12% to 18%), and nausea and vomiting (1% to 3.6%), are not uncommon 5, 6. To increase tolerability of docetaxel, alternative schedules have been extensively studied. Accumulating evidence suggests that a weekly schedule of docetaxel (35 mg,m2) reduces severe and febrile neutropenia without decreasing antitumor activity 7 10. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and non hematologic toxicity 7. For the same reason, a lower dose of docetaxel (60 mg,m2 every 3 weeks) has been recommended in Japan 11, 12. However, recent large scale trials with such a dose of docetaxel still revealed high incidences of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (up to 82.9%) 12 14. Different schedules of low dose docetaxel have not been studied, nor has a comparison been made between low dose docetaxel and the less toxic agent, pemetrexed. Currently, the investigators have been following a schedule of weekly low dose docetaxel (30 mg,m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks; 60 mg,m2 accumulated dose for each cycle) at our hospital in an effort to achieve better tolerability (in press chemotherapy 2010). The investigators therefore perform an exploratory study, by prospective analysis, to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of such a low dose docetaxel schedule compared to that of pemetrexed in patients with NSCLC who are chemotherapy naive. Erlotinib, an orally available epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), significantly prolongs survival and produces significant symptom and quality of life benefits compared with best supportive care in unselected patients with relapsed non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 15, 16.

Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing.

NCT03101579,Intrathecal Pemetrexed for Recurrent Leptomeningeal Metastases From Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"It has been proved that intrathecal chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy for leptomeningeal metastases. At present, the commonly used drugs for intrathecal chemotherapy include methotrexate, cytarabine, and liposomal cytarabine. In recent decades, no new effective drugs have been discovered for intrathecal chemotherapy. The recurrence of leptomeningeal metastases is inevitable even after aggressive treatment. There is no effective treatment for recurrent leptomeningeal metastases after comprehensive treatment which includes intrathecal methotrexate and,or cytarabine, central nervous system radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. The quality of life is extremely poor, and the patients always die in short time. Pemetrexed is a newer multitargeted antifolate which has shown activity in various tumors. It has higher effectiveness and safety, which has been used as the first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer. In animal studies, pemetrexed was demonstrated to suppress tumor growth completely in mice with two types of transplanted human colon xenografts resistant to methotrexate.

NCT01631136,Strategies for Maintenance Therapies in Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"In France, lung cancer is responsible for more than 30000 each year. Progress was made in treatment of lung cancer in the last five years due to targeted therapies and to strategical evolutions consisting in a best adjustment of treatments. Maintenance strategies is one of this strategical evolution. It is based on maintaining continuous therapeutical pression in order to preserve the therapeutical benefit obtained by the first line (induction chemotherapy). Several clinical trials showed that maintenance strategies increase the duration of controlled disease. There is two types of maintenance strategies: Continuous maintenance : prolongation of the treatment initially associated with platin until progression. Switch maintenance : introduction of a new treatment after the end of induction chemotherapy The aim of this study is to compare two maintenance strategies A continuous maintenance by pemetrexed.

NCT00349089,Trial on Refinement of Early Stage Lung Cancer Adjuvant Therapy,"The purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to determine the clinical feasibility  in terms of patients without dose limiting toxicities or premature treatment withdrawal or death  of the combination of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and of the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine. The combination of Cisplatin , Pemetrexed is assumed to be distinctly less toxic than Vinorelbine , Cisplatin.","Derived from recent large randomized clinical trials, there is clear evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB IIB (incidental IIIA) non small cell lung cancer (Arriagada et al., 2004; Winton et al., 2005, Strauss et al., 2004, Douillard et al., 2005). The majority of patients in the adjuvant treatment setting received a combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine (Aragiada et al., 2004; Winton et al., 2005; Douillard et al., 2005). This combination improved 5 year survival rates up to 15% (54% to 69%) (Winton et al., 2005). However, the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine resulted in rates of grade 3,4 neutropenia of around 75%, rates of febrile neutropenia of up to 12.5% and rates of treatment related death of 1 2%. Up to 77% of the patients had at least one dose reduction or omission and 55% required one dose delay or more, most related to neutropenia. Only about 50 % of patients randomized on the combination of cisplatin and vinorelbine received the intended dose of Vinorelbine (dose reduction mainly due to toxicity) and only 50% of patients completed all four cycles of chemotherapy (Winton et al., 2005, Douillard et al., 2005, Alam et al., 2005). Therefore it seems reasonable to test a less toxic regimen also in early stages after R0 resection of the tumor, where reduced toxicities might improve the feasibility of drug delivery, compliance and the convenience of treatment for the patient and hence perhaps survival. Pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite, shows clear activity in non small cell lung cancer with several Phase II studies of Pemetrexed in combination with Cisplatin, Oxaliplatin, or Carboplatin showing efficacy similar to other standard platinum doublets, with response rates of 27% to 45% and median survival of 8.9 to 10.9 months (Scagliotti et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2002; Rusthoven et al., 1999; Manegold et al., 2000; Shepherd et al., 2001). The combination of platin and Pemetrexed can be easily delivered and is well tolerated. Furthermore, it only results in a 25% rate of grade 3,4 neutropenia and in vitamin supplemented patients the incidence of febrile neutropenia was < 1%. Dose reductions occur only in 2 4% of the patients and dose delivery of the intended Pemetrexed and platin dose is excellent with dose deliveries of Pemetrexed up to 95% (Hanna et al., 2004; Vogelzang et al., 2003, Scagliotti et al., 2005). In this randomized phase II trial, the clinical feasibility of the combination of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as of the combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine will be assessed. Treatment is considered to have clinical feasibility if dose limiting toxicity will not be observed, and no non acceptance by the patient leading to premature withdrawal, and no death due to cancer or cancer therapy will occur. Patients will be randomized according to center, lobectomy vs. pneumonectomy and N0 vs. N1 to 4 cycles (arm A) of 500 mg,m2 pemetrexed d1, and Cisplatin 75 mg,m2 d1, q d22 versus (arm B) 25 mg,m2 Vinorelbine d1, 8, 15, 22, and Cisplatin 50 mg,m2 d1+8; q d29. Radiotherapy or maintenance therapy are not intended. Study drug administration will begin on d28 to d42 after R0 resection of the tumor and within 14 days after randomization. In an initial study phase 36 patients (i.e. 18 in each treatment arm) will be accrued to confirm feasibility. In the second step, further patients will be recruited up to a total number of 134 (i.e. 67 cases per treatment arm).

Docetaxel has proven superior compared to best supportive care (BSC) in chemotherapy naïve as well as in platinum pretreated patients. In addition, docetaxel is active in cisplatin refractory or resistant patients, producing responses ranging from 18% to 25%, implying a lack of cross resistance between docetaxel and cisplatin, probably due to their different mechanisms of action. Furthermore, docetaxel is associated with significant prolongation of survival when administered as second line therapy, in pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. Phase II studies of pemetrexed in previously untreated patients with NSCLC have demonstrated single agent response rates of 17% to 23%. A phase II study of pemetrexed in patients with advanced NSCLC, who had progressed during or within 3 months of completing first line chemotherapy, demonstrated a response rate of 8.9% and median survival time of 5.7 months. Multivariate analysis established an association between an increased risk of severe pemetrexed toxicity and elevated homocysteine (folate and,or B12 vitamin deficiency marker) levels. Since December 1999, all pemetrexed treated patients are required to receive folic acid and Vitamin B12.

NCT03655834,Dose Individualization of Pemetrexed  IMPROVE III,"Rationale: Pemetrexed is a multi targeted folate antagonist, which is primarily indicated for the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. Dosing of cytotoxic agents like pemetrexed requires balancing the dual risk of sub therapy and toxicity. Administration of pemetrexed to patients with a creatinine clearance <45 ml,min is currently not advised. Pemetrexed is dosed based on body surface area (BSA), while renal function and dose are the sole determinants for systemic exposure. This causes 3 major issues: In patients with renal dysfunction, BSA based dosing may lead to haematological toxicity. Patients have to discontinue treatment due to declining renal function, and are withheld effective treatment. Even in patients with adequate renal function (GFR >45 ml,min) treatment may be improved by individualized dosing based on renal function, resulting in less toxicity. Also, BSA based dosing may lead to ineffective therapy in patients with above average renal function. The investigators aim to address these problems. Objective: The overall main objective is to develop a safe and effective individualized dosing regimen for pemetrexed.

NCT01296113,Chemotherapy for Lung Cancer in HIV positive Patients,"This is a phase II, multicenter, non randomized, open label study evaluating the combination of pemetrexed plus carboplatin in HIV positive patients with lung cancer.","The use of tritherapy in developed countries starting in 1996 led to a considerable reduction in AIDS mortality due to opportunistic infections and AIDS defining cancers. However, increased life expectancies were accompanied by a diversification of the causes of death in HIV infected individuals. In France between 2000 and 2005, non AIDS defining mortality rose from 53% to 64%: non AIDS defining cancers (apart from hepatocellular carcinoma) had the highest mortality rates, increasing from 11% to 17% in 2005, followed by liver disease (15% in 2005), cardiovascular disease (8% in 2005) and suicide (5%). Among all cancer related deaths (AIDS and non AIDS defining), the proportion due to non AIDS defining cancers (apart from hepatocellular carcinoma) increased from 38% to 50% and lung cancer (LC) accounted for 65% of deaths. Many epidemiological studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of LC in HIV infected individuals HIV positive subjects are younger at diagnosis of LC than the general population (45 versus 62 years). In the most recent studies, adenocarcinoma comprised 70% of cases. The prognosis of LC is worse in HIV positive individuals. Some authors suggest that these poor outcomes may be related to interactions and additive toxicities of the cytotoxic and antiretroviral drugs. It is also likely that the disease is particularly aggressive. In the general population with a PS of 0 or 1 and under 70 years of age, bitherapy improves survival as compared to monotherapy. Survival is higher when the doublet comprises a platin. Since HIV positive subjects with LC tend to be young, it is logical to offer them the best treatment which has demonstrated efficacy in the general population. In comparison to cisplatin, carboplatin causes less vomiting, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Survival is very slightly higher with cisplatin, but this comes at the cost of greater toxicity. Carboplatin is better tolerated in subjects with PS=2 or who are over 70 years of age The HIV positive population is specific in that: PS is more often altered but the subjects are young, which calls for a platin based doublet.. HAART is essential and its absorption should not be compromised by repeated vomiting which is more severe with cisplatin.. Nephropathy occurs in 15 38% of cases; the causes are multifactorial and include the HIV virus itself and the antiretroviral drugs (Tenofovir®).. Peripheral neuropathy is frequently related to HIV or to the antiretroviral treatments (especially didanosine or stavudine (2010 YENI report)).. Premature ageing is seen in HIV positive subjects; this exposes them to increased cardiovascular risk and a higher frequency of heart disease which can restrict the hyper hydration required when using cisplatin.. In 2010, virtually all patients are treated on an ambulatory basis whereas in the past they would have been hospitalized. Carboplatin is administered in the day hospital of all the centers, but not cisplatin.. It is important to preserve an optimal quality of life during the first line of therapy in these patients whose life expectancy is such that very few will be eligible for a second round of therapy. Scagliotti published a phase III trial comparing cisplatin plus pemetrexed with cisplatin plus gemcitabine in subjects < 70 years old with advanced stage NSCLC. Overall survival was identical in both arms but the toxicity profile was in favor of the pemetrexed arm. The combination of first line carboplatin plus pemetrexed has been evaluated in several phase II trials, particularly in subjects with a poor PS. In contrast to the taxanes or vinorelbine, for example, pemetrexed is not metabolized by CYP450, which facilitates its use in combination with protease inhibitors and NNRTI, which respectively inhibit or induce the CYP450 system. Ancillary study BIO IFCT 1001 will be made. Since the samples will be small, focus will be on the biomarkers associated with multiple or specific resistance to platinum salts or to pemetrexed, particularly those more specifically found in NSCLC of nonsquamous histology. Similarly, biomarkers for which IFCT pathologists have acquired an expertise will also be favored. This expertise mainly involves, on the one hand, detecting K Ras mutations (15 25% of ADC) and RasSF1 methylation as well as TubIII expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and testing for mucosecretion by PAS diastase resistant staining, and on the other hand, evaluating ERCC1 and,or MSH2 expression and thymidylate synthase (TS) expression by IHC.",Completed,All,18 Years,75 Years,IFCT,3 weeks,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Hiv positive",Chemotherapy

NCT03537833,Association Between Proton Pump Inhibitors and Hematologic Toxicity of Pemetrexed,"Pemetrexed is a multi folate inhibitor approved in the treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pleural mesothelioma. Its toxicity profile is mainly hematologic (anemia, neutropenia and thrombopenia) and can be limiting when > grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE criteria. First clinical trials highlighted hematologic toxicity, especially anemia, which was reduced by decreasing pemetrexed dosage from 600 to 500 mg,m² Q3W and by adding systematic vitamin supplementation (B9,B12). Despite this, incidence of hematological toxicity remains frequent with anemia occurring in more than 20% of patients treated by pemetrexed in combination. Methotrexate, a well known antineoplastic drugs used in several cancer and non cancer disease conditions can also induced severe hematologic toxicity in case of methotrexate reduced elimination and, as a consequence, its accumulation. For example, the elimination of methotrexate is mediated by tubular secretion through type 1 and type 3 organic anion transport (hOAT1 and hOAT3). Association with drugs that inhibits hOATs can induced a hematological toxicity caused by methotrexate accumulation. Among these, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to inhibit hOATs. The drug interaction that results from their combination with methotrexate is clinically relevant and lead to an increased hematological toxicity. However, hypothetical drug interaction between PPIs and pemetrexed is unknown while pemetrexed seems to be mostly eliminated by hOAT3 (11 fold higher than methotrexate). One study revealed lansoprazole to inhibits in vitro hOAT3. This same study investigates in a retrospective chart patients treated by pemetrexed and the study found a significant association between combination with PPI and hematological toxicity by pemetrexed. Unfortunately this study lacks of relevant methodology and suffered from its retrospective chart. This potential drug interaction must be a real concern for oncologists and clinical pharmacists. The investigators aim to investigate the potential association between PPIs and pemetrexed combination and the incidence of hematological toxicity in a multicenter and prospective study.","Prospective, longitudinal, multicenter and observational study.

However, patients are only candidates for maintenance therapy if they have responded to their previous treatment or have stable disease and their tumors have not progressed. Pemetrexed, docetaxel and gemcitabine have been approved for chemotherapy maintenance in the NCCN Guide. Chemotherapy maintenance can be partly extend patients TTP, but the toxicity and the side effects of chemotherapy will decrease the QOL, and even lose the opportunity to receive subsequent therapy. Besides, high cost of chemotherapy will cause greater economic pressure on patients.

NCT00577707,Erlotinib and Chemotherapy for Patients With Stage IB IIIA NSCLC With EGFR Mutations (ECON),"The purpose of this study is to try to improve the odds that your cancer may be cured. Pemetrexed and cisplatin are traditional chemotherapy drugs that have been shown to help some patients with non small cell lung cancer. Many different types of cancer cells, including your type of lung cancer, have a protein on their surface called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Stimulation of these receptors can result in growth of cancer cells and progression of cancer. In addition, your cancer has an EGFR mutation (a specific abnormality in the genetic code for EGFR). Erlotinib (TarcevaTM) is a newer drug which has shown benefit for patients with lung cancers that contain an EGFR mutation. Erlotinib works by blocking this receptor and depriving the cancer cells of this message to grow and multiply. In this research study, we plan to combine erlotinib with traditional chemotherapy drugs to see if the combination works better than chemotherapy alone. The main purpose of this research is to find out the good and bad effects that the combination of these 3 drugs (pemetrexed, cisplatin and erlotinib) has when given to patients with early stage non small cell lung cancer before surgery. A secondary purpose is to find out the good and bad effects that occur when erlotinib is given to patients after surgery for 2 years.","Chemotherapy and surgery in combination represents the standard of care for patients with resectable stage IB IIIA NSCLC. However, the 5 year survival continues to be disappointing despite this standard of care. This study incorporates targeted therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as part of a multimodality strategy for stage IB IIIA resectable NSCLC tumors with a known EGFR activating mutation.

NCT03380871,A Personal Cancer Vaccine (NEO PV 01) With Pembrolizumab and Chemotherapy for Patients With Lung Cancer,"The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO PV 01 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (pembrolizumab,chemotherapy) is safe and useful for patients with lung cancer. The study also will assess if the NEO PV 01 vaccine, when given together with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, can improve your response compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment alone. All eligible patients will receive NEO PV 01 + Adjuvant, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy while on this trial.","This clinical trial will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non small cell lung carcinoma not having received treatment for metastatic disease. The five agents being used in this study are: A new, investigational, personalized cancer vaccine called NEO PV 01. Poly ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the immune system. A cancer drug called pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®). A chemotherapy called pemetrexed (ALIMPTA®). A chemotherapy called carboplatin Both NEO PV 01 and pembrolizumab are considered immunotherapies and work using the immune system to fight cancer. NEO PV 01 is a custom made vaccine for you that is based on the specific targets on your cancer. Poly ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make the vaccine, NEO PV 01, more effective. Pembrolizumab helps T cells, a certain type of immune cell, that recognize these targets to reach and attack your cancer. Pembrolizumab, which is approved in the USA and some other countries, is available by prescription to treat several different cancers, including the type of cancer that you have. Recently, the FDA also approved the combination of Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for the treatment of your type of lung cancer. This combination works better than each of the drugs on their own. The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO PV 01 in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy is safe and useful for patients with lung cancer. The study also will assess if the NEO PV 01 vaccine, when given together with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, can improve your immune response compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy treatment alone.

NCT00703976,"Radiation, Cetuximab and Pemetrexed With or Without Bevacizumab in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer","The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of chemoradiotherapy with or without Bevacizumab (Avastin). Chemoradiotherapy is the combination of chemotherapy (the drugs pemetrexed and cetuximab) and radiation. Pemetrexed is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for head and neck cancer when used in combination with radiation therapy. Cetuximab is also approved by the FDA for head and neck cancers in patients who have failed other chemotherapy treatments. Bevacizumab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer in combination of chemotherapy. In this study, the use of bevacizumab is investigational.","Background Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) are increasingly treated with primary chemoradiotherapy. The incorporation of novel targeted therapies to chemoradiotherapy is of major interest since it may potentially improve efficacy without significantly increasing toxicity. Radiation and cetuximab, a chimeric anti epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody, has emerged as a standard non surgical therapy for stage III,IV HNSCC. Bevacizumab, an anti vascular endothelial growth factor antibody is currently being investigated in HNSCC with promising results. A phase II study investigating the combination of pemetrexed and bevacizumab in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC is currently ongoing at our institution with encouraging results (UPCI# 05 002). In addition, we are completing a phase I trial of radiation, cetuximab plus pemetrexed (UPCI #05 005). Pemetrexed was dose escalated in successive cohorts of patients on 3 dose levels: starting dose level (0) 350 mg,m2, dose level ( 1) 200 mg,m2, dose level (+1) 500 mg,m2. Currently three patients have been treated at dose level +1 (pemetrexed 500 mg,m2) which will be the pemetrexed dose in this study. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been observed at this dose level, which was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination regimen in previously non irradiated patients. Specific aims To evaluate the progression free survival at 2 years (primary endpoint), locoregional and distant disease free survival, overall survival, toxicities and quality of life with the combination of radiation, cetuximab and pemetrexed with or without bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced HNSCC. Also, we plan to collect tumor tissue from previous diagnostic procedures and baseline blood specimens for future correlative studies. Subject population We will enroll patients with previously untreated stage III,IV squamous cell carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma of the head and neck (except nasopharynx and unknown primary). Patients should not have active bleeding due to HNSCC or history of persistent bleeding due to HNSCC that required major intervention (surgery or embolization) to be controlled. Please see section 3 for detailed eligibility criteria. Treatment plan Patients will be randomized in two arms. In arm A, patients will be treated with radiation 2Gy,day for 7 weeks to a total of 70 Gy, cetuximab 250mg,m2 weekly during radiation, after a loading dose of 400mg,m2 one week prior starting radiation, and pemetrexed 500mg,m2 every 21 days for 3 cycles. In arm B, patients will be treated with the same regimen with the addition of bevacizumab 15mg,kg every 21 days for 3 cycles (see section 5 for detailed treatment plan and dose modifications). Statistical design and sample size Phase II, randomized, multi center study with progression free survival at 2 years as the primary endpoint. The historical control is a 2 year progression free survival of 46% with radiation plus cetuximab alone. We assume a 2 year progression free survival of 64% (40% relative improvement in progression free survival over historical control) as worthy of further testing. We will require 40 evaluable patients per arm for a total of 80 patients.

It is likely that an agent that could effectively target hypoxic regions in tumors would improve efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TH 302 is activated at lower oxygen concentrations than other bioreductive prodrugs (Duan 2008) and tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin that has been extensively studied in both preclinical and clinical studies. This should result in an improved therapeutic ratio (tumor vs normal tissue toxicity) as compared with other bioreductive agents. Because TH 302 is expected to be minimally toxic to aerobic cancer cells, optimal efficacy would be expected when TH 302 is combined with treatments that are most effective under aerobic conditions such as radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preclinical data have shown at least additive efficacy when TH 302 is combined with either docetaxel or gemcitabine. In order to minimize the risk of additive toxicity, TH 302 is not being evaluated in combination with alkylating agents.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Phase 1,2, Advanced Solid Tumors, Hypoxia, Prodrug, Dose Escalation, Evofosfamide",Two years,Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer",TH 302

The aim is to validate the use of a simplified geriatric scale (SGS) as a screening tool. If the SGS results are normal, the patient will be treated with dual agent therapy based on platinum (carboplatin + pemetrexed if the histology is non epidermoid, carboplatin + gemcitabin if the histology is epidermoid), with no further geriatric assessment. When the SGS reveals abnormalities, a comprehensive geriatric evaluation (CGE) will be used to define two subpopulations on Balduccis fragility scale, who will receive either monotherapy (docetaxel) or best supportive care. The strategy based on the SGS will be compared with a treatment algorithm based on standard criteria (PS and age), with no specific geriatric assessment. The main endpoint is the time to treatment failure. The SGS is composed of the Charlson co morbidity scale, functional assessment based on PS, Katz ADL scale, Lawtons simplified IADL scale, simplified cognitive assessment with the mini MMSE according to Schultz Larsen, a geriatric depression scale (GDS 5), and screening for a geriatric syndrome defined by the existence of dementia, repeated falls, and urinary and fecal incontinence.

NCT02679443,Vitamin Supplementation in NSCLC Patients on Pemetrexed Based Chemotherapy,"Folic acid (FA; folate) in the dose of 350 1,000 μg daily should be supplemented, daily, starting 7 days before the first dose of pemetrexed based chemotherapy and should be continued while the patient is on therapy and for 21 days after cessation of therapy. Vitamin B12 injections (1,000 μg i.m.) should also be started 1 week before the first dose of chemotherapy. However, the evidence for delaying chemotherapy by seven days for the purpose of giving vitamin B12 and FA supplementation is not robust. Observational and prospective single arm studies have not shown any increased toxicity if pemetrexed was started earlier than the recommended duration of supplementation. In a resource constrained setting, this will lead to one additional visit and 1 week chemotherapy delay which may be inconvenient for patients. Hence an open label, randomized control trial is being undertaken to evaluate if there are any differences in pemetrexed related hematological toxicity amongst patients who receive delayed initiation of chemotherapy (following 5  7 days of vitamin B12 and FA supplementation; Delayed Arm) as compared to those in whom vitamin B12 and FA supplementation is starting simultaneously (within 24 hours) of initiation of chemotherapy (Immediate Arm).","Chemotherapy Regimen: All patients will receive pemetrexed and cisplatin in doses of 500 mg and 65 mg, respectively, per square meter of body surface area each on day 1 of a 3 week cycle. Patients with contraindications to administration of cisplatin, those who are intolerant to cisplatin, or develop grade 3 or 4 adverse events from cisplatin will be given carboplatin in combination with pemetrexed. Carboplatin will be given at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of 5.0mg,mL,min.

Another goal of this research study is to gain information about how the body handles pemetrexed and how pemetrexed may work to treat the participants lymphoma in the nervous system. Pemetrexed (also known as Alimta) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of some lung cancers and has been shown to be effective in laboratory studies. Information from these studies suggests that pemetrexed may help to treat patients with either primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma.","Since we are looking for the highest dose of pemetrexed that can be given to people safely, not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same amount of the study drug. The dose participants will receive will depend upon the number of people that have been enrolled on the study before them and how well they have tolerated their doses of the study drug.. Pemetrexed is given into a vein (by IV) over a 10 to 20 minute period once every 14 days. This 14 day period is called a cycle of study treatment.. Study treatment will be divided into three phases. Induction: Participants will be given a maximum of 8 cycles. If the participant does not achieve a complete response after eight induction cycles, they will be taken off study. A complete response means there is no evidence of disease on MRI or CT scan. Consolidation: If the participant has achieved complete response, they will have two additional cycles. Maintenance: Following the completion of the consolidation cycles, participants will receive the study drug only once per month. They can continue to receive maintenance cycles for up to a year from the start of the first induction cycle.. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are two vitamins that have been shown to help lessen the severity of some side effects of pemetrexed. Participants will begin taking oral folic acid tablets at least 5 days before their first dose of pemetrexed and daily until 3 weeks after their last dose. Vitamin B12 is given through injections into your muscle. Participants will receive their first vitamin B12 injection 1 2 weeks before their first dose of pemetrexed. They will receive injections every 9 weeks.. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone have been shown to help prevent severe skin rashes associated with pemetrexed. Participants will receive dexamethasone twice daily starting the day before each pemetrexed infusion continuing until the day after each infusion.. On day 1 of each cycle the following will be performed: a physical examination, blood work, vital signs, assessment of who well the participant is functioning, and mini mental examination. On day 8 of each cycle blood work will be performed.. Research blood work will be obtained (PKs) over the first four days of cycles 1 and 2 (or study participation days 1 4 and 15 18)..

The peak incidence occurs in children and young adults with a second peak occurring in middle age, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in young, productive individuals. Although limb preserving surgery and radiation therapy have improved the primary treatment of these tumors, the therapy of advanced, metastatic tumors is unsatisfactory. The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Alimta and gemcitabine given on day 1 of a 14 day cycle to patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas. Gemcitabine is an established salvage therapy for soft tissue sarcomas in combination with docetaxel. Alimta is a multitargeted antifolate drug which inhibits several folate dependent enzymes required for cell proliferation. Alimta has shown efficacy in several solid tumor types both as a single agent and in combination with other agents. The combination of Alimta and gemcitabine is synergistic and is likely to have efficacy against soft tissue sarcomas. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate among patients with unresectable soft tissue sarcoma treated with this combination. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the median survival of this patient population, as well as time to objective tumor response, time to treatment failure and overall survival.

Although pembrolizumab (anti PD1) was recently approved as first line treatment for patients with at least 50% of their NSCLC cells expressing PDL1, many patients are still not benefiting from this first line agent. For patients with relapsed NSCLC, atezolizumab (anti PDL1) prolonged survival compared to docetaxel in the phase II POPLAR and phase III OAK trials. Novel concepts of synergic action between immunotherapy and chemotherapy have emerged recently. However, those types of treatments are given for different durations: chemotherapy is allowed for only a short period (rarely exceeding 6 cycles), while anti PDL1 can be continued for several months until loss of its clinical benefit. Metronomic chemotherapy is defined as low dose and frequent chemotherapy administration, without prolonged drug free breaks. Metronomic administration of oral vinorelbine has been tested against breast cancer and advanced refractory NSCLC. The combination could have immunostimulatory effects: induction of immunogenic cancer cell death, enhancement of antigen presentation through dendritic cell modulation, increased cancer cell immunogenicity, preferential depletion of regulatory T cells, modulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells, enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of immune effector cells.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,"immunotherapy, second line of chemotherapy",4 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"Atezolizumab, Vinorelbine"

The institutional review board of Sotiria Chest Diseases Hospital of Athens approved it. The trial adhered to Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and all patients or their legal representatives provided informed consent. Patients: The trial enrolled patients with metastatic LCNEC originating from the lung. Eligible patients had not received prior systemic treatment for LCNEC. Patients with brain metastases at diagnosis underwent Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) before starting systemic treatment. Study Design: The experimental group received a combination treatment regimen consisting of four cycles of Carboplatin, Etoposide, and Atezolizumab every 21 days. Patients who achieved stable disease (SD) or a response (partial or complete) continued maintenance treatment with Atezolizumab until disease progression or discontinuation due to severe adverse events. The control group received four cycles of Carboplatin and Etoposide. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were not allowed in later lines of treatment for the control group.

Among programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD L1) inhibitors, atezolizumab (Tecentriq® ), a PD L1 inhibitor, has been shown to ameliorate outcomes for NSCLC patients with metastatic disease: The open label phase II multicenter studies POPLAR and BIRCH revealed an improved overall response rate and a benefit in overall survival (OS) under atezolizumab monotherapy. The open label, randomized phase III OAK trial led to atezolizumab approval as monotherapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease progressed during or following platinumcontaining chemotherapy regardless of PD L1 status. Despite these developments, platinum based chemotherapy regimens are still standard of care for lung cancer without druggable alterations. Lately combining conventional chemotherapeutics with immunotherapy showed promising results: A phase I study of first line atezolizumab plus chemotherapy demonstrated efficacy regardless of PD L1 status and an acceptable safety profile in multiple tumor types. Accordingly, ongoing phase III trials address potential benefits of platinum based immunotherapy combinations in comparison to standard platinum containing regimens in first line NSCLC and SCLC. If additional bevacizumab might further enhance atezolizumab efficacy by inhibiting vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) related immunosuppression is currently investigated in the IMpower150 trial. Patients under intensive care for advanced cancers develop symptoms due to cancer progression and, possibly, due to therapy related sideeffects. These symptoms are often not detected promptly by the treating physician leading to functional impairment and deconditioning of the patients status with potential implications for the general outcome. Improved symptom control in late stage cancer under exhaustive therapy regimens was achieved through intensified symptom management. Systematic collection of symptom information by electronic patientreported outcomes (ePROs) in addition to clinical routine provides an attractive basis for intensified symptom management. However, despite new, intriguing results, the proof of a significant benefit (defined as primary outcome measure) under first line treatment is still limited in oncology trials. In the palliative setting of lung cancer, routine treatment monitoring includes imaging at certain intervals. However, as approaching imaging assessments clarify the patients fate, they are often a source for anxiety and concern. Additionally, patients with emerging symptoms often wait until the next routinely scheduled consultation with their treating oncologist. As a consequence, tumor progression without therapeutic hindrance over several weeks may occur and naturally shorten the patients survival time. Clinical monitoring via self assessed symptom based approaches endows several benefits. Remarkably, 75 95% of relapses in lung cancer patients come with symptoms and, thus, a direct PRO measurement might be useful in the detection of an early disease progression. Easily accessible web based application tools such as CANKADO were developed to report PROs more frequently compared to routine assessment. These tools help to strengthen the connection between patient and treating physician and to reduce patients anxiety. Of note, even during treatment with toxic chemotherapy, most patients are willing and able to self report via the web. Physicians appreciate PROs and trust in patient reported information. In line with this, several promising studies confirmed a benefit from proactive, web based monitoring programs. If symptoms occurred or worsened, the respective physician was informed earlier what resulted n improved OS, quality of life (QoL) and also in economic advantages due to less unnecessary routine check ups. So far, these studies were performed on heterogeneous patient populations during chemotherapy. The current study is aimed to test the benefit of a web based application tool in NSCLC, SCLC and TNBC patients during the recently approved first line treatment strategy with atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,72 months,,,,"Stage IV Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Extensive stage Small Cell Lung Cancer, Advanced (Locally Advanced and Inoperable or Metastatic), PD L1 IC positive TNBC",eHealth system support for symptom management via CANKADO

NCT01562028,BELIEF (Bevacizumab and ErLotinib In EGFR Mut+ NSCLC),"Rationale: Advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (del19 or L858R) show an impressive progression free survival between 9 and 14 months when treated with erlotinib. However, the presence of EGFR mutations can only imperfectly predict outcome. The investigators hypothesize that progression free survival could be influenced both by the pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation and by components of DNA repair pathways. The investigators propose a model of treatment whereby patients with EGFR mutations (single or with T790M) can attain a benefit with longer overall PFS when treated with erlotinib plus bevacizumab. When the patients are grouped by BRCA1 mRNA levels and T790M the hypothesis is that the combination of erlotinib plus bevacizumab can improve the PFS in all subgroups.","Objectives: To determine long term outcome of patients with advanced non squamous NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations with or without T790M mutation at diagnosis and treated with the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab.

We aim at this early identification by the combination of molecular and functional imaging tools (FDG , FLT PET, DCE MRI), molecular marker analyses in tissue and peripheral blood (EGFR and KRAS mutational status and high throughput mutational profiling in tumor tissue, angiogenesis associated biomarkers and expression profiling in peripheral blood) and pharmokokinetic analyses. From the combined analyses of these tools we expect a better understanding of the host drug interaction as a precondition for further improvement of erlotinib bevacizumab combination therapy in NSCLC",,Completed,All,18 Years,99 Years,"NSCLC, Lung Cancer",24 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,"Erlotinib, Bevacizumab, Fluoro D glucose, Fluoro L thymidine, Gadolinium DPTA"

The introduction of new targeted drugs creates the need of a different response assessment. Functional imaging techniques are able to study in vivo physiological processes of angiogenesis. Therefore, dynamic techniques may be more appropriate for assessing response to antiangiogenic drugs, whose mechanism of action is focused on tumors vasculature normalization. Preliminary studies have demonstrated significant and very early changes in indirect vasculature parameters such as flow, blood volume and tumor perfusion with vascular targeting agents. These techniques may be useful for selecting patients who are going to benefit from antiangiogenic therapy by an early evaluation of response by means of functional imaging method.

NCT00250978,"Ph I:Bevacizumab + Chemotherapy in Pts w,Malig Pleural Effusion Due to Adv NSCLC","Your lung cancer has caused fluid to build up in the space around your lung. This fluid is called a malignant pleural effusion. This fluid takes up space in your chest, and prevents your lung from fully filling with air. As a result, you may be experiencing shortness of breath, cough, or chest discomfort. Your doctors have determined that you would feel better if a surgeon or pulmonary specialist removed this fluid immediately. Your doctors are offering to admit you to the hospital, and drain the fluid using a Pleur XTM catheter. Once the Pleur X catheter is in place, your doctors would like to start your chemotherapy. Your doctors have decided to treat you with chemotherapy. If the chemotherapy works to kill the cancer cells in your body, the cancer will make less fluid, and your doctors will be able to remove the Pleur XTM catheter sooner. It is possible that adding a second drug to the chemotherapy, called bevacizumab may make he fluid dry up even faster. It is not known whether adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for patients with a Pleur XTM catheter in place is more helpful, or potentially more harmful, than using chemotherapy alone. For this reason, only patients enrolled in this research protocol can receive both chemotherapy and bevacizumab while they have a Pleur XTM catheter in place. The purpose of this research study is to determine whether chemotherapy may be delivered safely with a Pleur XTM catheter in place.","The study will be conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB IV) who have MPE requiring therapeutic drainage, and are also eligible for treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (as defined in protocol Section 6.0).

Only patients who, in the opinion of the treating physician, do not have a hemorrhagic pleural effusion (grossly bloody, or pleural fluid hemoglobin concentration > 25% of blood hemoglobin concentration) may remain on study. In addition, only patients who, in the opinion of the treating physician, have satisfactory placement of their Pleur XTM catheter may remain on study. Approximately 15 patients will be enrolled with the goal to treat 10 patients with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. The additional enrollments will be necessary in that it is estimated that approximately 1 in 3 patients will be taken off study due to failure of Pleur XTM catheter placement, or discovery of hemorrhagic effusion. Patients who remain on study will begin chemotherapy. All eligible patients will receive bevacizumab 15mg,kg IV x 1 dose as a single agent.

Docetaxel chemotherapy was considered one of the valid non platinum containing therapeutic options at that time and today represents one of the approved second line treatment options after failure of first line platinum based chemotherapy. The trial was terminated early due to slow accrual after enrollment of 51 patients and was published in 2014, showing no clinically meaningful difference between the two treatment arms. Based on the aforementioned trial population,a parallel radiological study was conducted, evaluating sequential tumor metrics on computed tomography performed at baseline and after each cycle of treatment in patients receiving either bevacizumab or docetaxel,erlotinib. Given the differential mechanism of action of these agents, it was hypothesized that the different parameters of radiological tumor response evaluation, namely the maximum diameter, tumor volume and tumor density, would respond differently for each therapeutic category (a chemotherapeutic agent, a molecular agent and and an anti angiogenic agent). For bevacizumab, in particular, it was hypothesized that its unique mechanism of action, inducing central tumor necrosis and subsequent shrinkage, would lead to completely different tumor metrics as compared to the other two agents.

This trial is intended to provide pilot data for a future randomized trial of this combination of targeted agents versus conventional chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC.","The combination of Bevacizumab and Erlotinib show encouraging activity for patients with previously treated, non small cell lung cancer. In a phase I,II study of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with nonsquamous stage IIIB,IV NSCLC with one or more prior chemotherapy exposures, a recommended phase II dose was established at erlotinib 150 mg,day orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg,kg intravenously every 21 days (13) Forty patients were treated at the recommended Phase II dose. The median age was 59 years (range, 36 to 72 years), 21 were female, 30 had adenocarcinoma histology, nine were never smokers, and 22 had > or = two prior regimens (three patients had > or = four prior regimens). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate rash, diarrhea, and proteinuria. No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified. Eight patients (20.0%; 95% CI, 7.6% to 32.4%) had partial responses and 26 (65.0%; 95% CI, 50.2% to 79.8%) had stable disease as their best response.

These data compare favorably with conventional chemotherapy in the salvage setting for NCSLC where the response rates are < 10% and median survivals are 6 8 months (14 16). In an attempt to improve the therapeutic index for initial therapy of metastatic NSCLC, the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib is being proposed as first line treatment in place of conventional chemotherapy. The regimen will be beneficial if toxicity is reduced and efficacy is unchanged or if efficacy is improved. Since this regimen causes no hair loss, minimal nausea and no cytopenia, which nearly eliminated the risks of infections and bleeding, the combination of targeted agents appears to be better tolerated than conventional chemotherapy. Efficacy may also be improved since its activity in the salvage setting when patients are less likely to respond to any treatment rivals that of conventional chemotherapy in the untreated setting. In addition, erlotinib alone in the untreated setting can yield results that are not dissimilar from chemotherapy under similar conditions. Hence, it is hypothesized that the combination of erlotinib plus bevacizumab can produce superior results with less toxicity.

Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor killing substances to them. Cetuximab and bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib together with cetuximab and,or bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

NCT00708448,"Early Prediction of Therapeutic Response to Targeted Therapy in Stage IIIB,IV or Recurrent Lung Cancer Patients","This exploratory clinical study is designed to obtain pre therapeutic imaging assessments using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 21 patients with Stage IIIB,IV or recurrent non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an early post therapy assessment at baseline and at various early time points (2 weeks in 7 patients, 4 weeks in 7 patients, and 6 weeks in 7 patients) after institution of erlotinib (anti EGFR) (Tarceva) and bevacizumab (anti VEGF) (Avastin) for first line treatment of Stage IIIB,IV or recurrent non squamous NSCLC. The proposed PET imaging and blood derived biomarkers trial is a companion study to an approved therapeutic trial (IRB# 24377). The therapeutic trial of erlotinib (Tarceva) and bevacizumab (Avastin) for first line treatment of Stage IIIB,IV or recurrent lung cancer with drug costs exceeding $150,000 per patient,year (study drug budget exceeds $5 million) was funded for study at the HCI and the HICCP, statewide trial network. The proposed imaging study has been funded by the University of Utah Synergy Grant Program. The clinical imaging biomarkers will include an assessment of tumor metabolism Banrasch 1986, Frauwirth 2002, Garber 2006, Kelloff 2005, Pauwels 1998, Semenza 2001, Smith 1999, Smith 2000, Sokoloff 1977, Warburg 1956, Weber 1977A, Weber (dynamic FDG PET); tumor proliferation Rasey 2002,Shields 2001,Shields 1998, Vesselle 2002, Schwartz 2003 (dynamic FLT PET); tumor blood flow and perfusion( H215O PET)Lodge 2000; and tumor blood volume of distribution ( H215O PET)Lodge 2000 in the same patient at baseline and then in the same patient at one of the post therapy time points (2 weeks, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks). The investigators hypothesize that by using a set of imaging derived biomarkers and biomarkers from blood they can predict response, either prior to or at an earlier time point than would normally be determined with standard imaging techniques, in patients with lung cancer receiving combined bevacizumab and erlotinib.","Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Non small cell lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States Jermal, 2007. Surgery can be curative for patients with stages I and II disease and chemoradiation for curative intent can be administered to selected patients with stage III disease in the setting of adequate performance status, minimal comorbid disease and absence of weight loss. Adjuvant therapy improves survival, but the relapse rate is high and may approach 80% for subsets of patients with presumed curable disease. Consequently, 85% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC will ultimately die of uncontrolled systemic disease. Systemic chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic disease, offers palliative benefit, improves survival, has substantial side effects, but is not curative. Improved systemic therapy with a greater therapeutic index due to greater efficacy or fewer side effects is sorely needed. Bevacizumab and,or erlotinib demonstrate these features. Therapeutic Drugs (Erlotinib and Bevacizumab) The therapeutic trial, which this molecular imaging and serum biomarker trial will compliment, will study the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab as first line treatment for patients with non squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This will be the first ever study where conventional chemotherapy will not be used as first line treatment in NSCLC. Both erlotinib, as a single agent after chemotherapy progression Shepherd 2005, and bevacizumab, in combination with chemotherapy Sandler 2006, have been approved for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. This is a multi center trial via Huntsman Cancer Institute  Intermountain Cancer Care Program, phase II, single stage, of erlotinib (150 mg,day) and bevacizumab (15 mg,kg IV every 21 days) for patients with non squamous, NSCLC without brain metastases or significant hemoptysis who have not received conventional chemotherapy as treatment for systemic or relapsed disease. Study treatment will be continued until symptomatic or objective progression. Patients progressing on or after this combination will subsequently receive conventional chemotherapy with bevacizumab at the discretion of the patient and treating physician. The study will be followed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee of the HCI and will enroll 40 patients. An interim safety analysis is scheduled after 20 patients have been accrued. For purposes of defining response the following criteria are used for all target lesions: complete response the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter; progressive disease at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; stable disease neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started. The primary exploratory objectives of the study are: Provide a reliable and validated cadre of PET imaging derived biomarkers and serum derived biomarkers that yield a better understanding of: 1) early clinical benefit from Avastin and Tarceva therapy, 2) efficacy during Avastin and Tarceva therapy, and 3) prognosis or other long term outcomes.. Reveal a more detailed understanding of: (1) the in vivo biologic mechanisms of Avastin and Tarceva in lung cancer and (2) information on why particular functional imaging assays and genomic biomarker profiles are seen in treated patients.. Reveal a more detailed understanding of how the combination of molecular imaging derived biomarkers in combination with gene expression profiles,biomarkers will be potentially useful to physicians for decision making and for explanation of efficacy or outcomes for patients with cancer.. Predict which patients may benefit from combined Avastin and Tarceva therapy..

NCT02835833,Study of Nintedanib Plus Bevacizumab in Advanced Solid Tumors,"Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels, plays an important role in the disease development and tumor growth in many solid organ malignancies. Bevacizumab was the first anti angiogenic drug to be approved in solid tumors and has shown advantageous activity with multiple tumor types. However, the responses from Bevacizumab are often transient due to the tumors manipulative abilities to circumvent the usual pathways to find salvage pathways instead. Nintedanib has demonstrated anti tumor activity in non squamous non small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell cancer.

NCT00588666,"Phase II Trial of Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and Bevacizumab in Chemotherapy Naive Patients With Advanced,Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma","Gemcitabine and carboplatin are two standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat tumors of the urothelial tract. These drugs do not shrink tumors in all patients and when they do, it is generally for a limited amount of time. This has led scientists to look for different ways to treat cancer. New drugs have been developed to treat cancer that work differently than standard chemotherapy drugs. One new class of drugs are called angiogenesis inhibitors. These drugs attempt to decrease the blood supply to tumors. By doing so, this may limit the tumors source of oxygen and nutrients and prevent the tumor from growing. Bevacizumab is an anti angiogenic drug. In some other cancers such as colon cancer and lung cancer, combining bevacizumab with standard chemotherapy shrinks tumors in a greater proportion of patients and makes patients live longer than using standard chemotherapy alone. This has never been tested in urothelial cancer and we do not know if bevacizumab will have the same effects in this disease. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and,or bad, the combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab has on you and your cancer.","This is a phase II trial of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in chemotherapy naïve patients with advanced,metastatic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelial tract.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Myeloproliferative Disorder, urinary bladder, Cancer, ureter, renal pelvis, chemotherapy",3 years,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Myeloproliferative Disorder, Urothelial Carcinoma, Cancer","Bevacizumab, Carboplatin, Gemcitabine"
NCT00923936,Pilot Study of Liposomal Doxorubicin Combined With Bevacizumab Followed by Bevacizumab Monotherapy in Adults With Advanced Kaposi s Sarcoma,"Background: The drug liposomal doxorubicin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Kaposis sarcoma (KS). A second drug, bevacizumab, is a biologic agent (such as antibodies, interleukins, and vaccines) that stops abnormal blood supply to tumors. Bevacizumab is approved by the FDA, in combination with other drugs, for the treatment of breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer.. Researchers are now studying the combination of liposomal doxorubicin with bevacizumab as a novel approach to the treatment of advanced KS. Researches will be measuring KS tumor responses to this combination to determine whether the drugs might have anti KS activity. Objectives: To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of six cycles of liposomal doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced KS.. To evaluate the safety of the regimen and to estimate the complete response rate after six cycles, the median number of cycles needed to obtain a partial response, and the 12 month progression free survival. Eligibility: Patients 18 years or older with relatively severe acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related KS or patients with KS unrelated to AIDS or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, whose KS that can be evaluated for potential response to therapy and meet a number of other criteria.. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.. Other ineligibility criteria include surgery within 4 weeks, chemotherapy within 3 weeks, heart disease, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), or gastrointestinal bleeding. Design: Researchers will conduct the following tests before the start of the study:. Physical examination and a detailed medical history.. A biopsy.. Blood and urine tests.. Treatment will include two phases, an induction phase and a maintenance phase:. Induction phase dose: Intravenous (IV) bevacizumab 15 mg,kg once, followed 7 days later by liposomal doxorubicin mg,m2 and bevacizumab every 3 weeks for six cycles. Maintenance phase dose: IV bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 11 cycles. Monitoring will include a review of side effects, physical exam (including blood pressure), and blood and urine samples; following the induction phase, the patient will receive a multi gated acquisition scan and electrocardiography (EKG) to record electrical activity in the heart.. Research tests include blood and saliva samples, additional biopsies (optional), and noninvasive imaging.. Treatment is stopped if any of the following occur: completion of 1 year of therapy, progressive KS, patient preference, or unacceptable toxicity.. Post treatment evaluations include clinic visits every 3 months or as needed up to 2 years, and blood and saliva samples (for research).","Background: Standard treatment for advanced Kaposis sarcoma (KS) is a liposomal anthracycline, plus antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).. KS is not curable and relapses are common. Prolonged use of liposomal anthracyclines with cumulative dosing exceeding 550 mg,m(2) is frequently required.. KS is notable for pathogenic autocrine and paracrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. The monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab is a rational agent for the treatment of KS.. Preliminary results from our phase II study of bevacizumab monotherapy, 03 C0110, suggest that bevacizumab has promising activity in the treatment of KS.. The combination of anti angiogenic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been a successful strategy in KS as well as other solid tumors.. This pilot study will evaluate the activity and safety of liposomal doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance in patients with advanced KS. A goal of this combination strategy is to develop a tolerable and highly active regimen that would limit the need for prolonged anthracycline use. Objectives: The primary objective is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of six cycles of liposomal doxorubicin combined with bevacizumab in patients with advanced KS.. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the safety of the regimen, as well as estimation of the complete response rate after 6 cycles, the median number of cycles need to obtain a partial response, and 12 month progression free survival. Eligibility: Inclusion criteria: Age greater than or equal to 18. Biopsy proven KS. Indication for chemotherapy. Any HIV status. Normal multigated acquisition scan (MUGA).

NCT00973557,The Effect of Monoclonal Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Antibody (Bevacizumab) on Pituitary Function,"The purpose of this research is to determine whether the drug, Bevacizumab (a monoclonal anti VEGF A antibody), which is approved to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer induces hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin secretion) in humans with intact pituitary function. Past studies have shown Bevacizumab to shrink tumor size and also increase prolactin levels. The mechanism of the hyperprolactinemia might be inhibition of pituitary portal vein transport, suggesting that Bevacizumab induces prolactin secretion from normal lactotrophs in the pituitary gland. Patients who have been treated with Bevacizumab for at least one month will be recruited to participate. The subjects who are being treated with Bevacizumab by Dr. Stephen Wolin (a sub investigator) will be screened by him for study eligibility. Dr. Wolin will approach eligible patients with all the information and background of the study and see if they have an interest in being consented. If consented, there will be 2 blood draws for the research that is not part of their standard care in which 10 ml of blood is collected and prolactin, growth hormone, IGF I, TSH, thyroxine, ACTH, and cortisol will be measured. One 5ml blood draw will occur before the administration of Bevacizumab and the second 5 ml blood draw will occur after the administration of the Bevacizumab. The investigators will then review the laboratory results. The blood tests are of the hormones of the pituitary gland to test pituitary function and see if there are any abnormalities with the secretions of the gland. Pituitary function abnormalities and hyperprolactinemia are diagnosed by looking at hormone levels in the blood and comparing them to the normal reference ranges.

NCT01931098,Oral Pazopanib Plus Oral Topotecan Metronomic Antiangiogenic Therapy for Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (A) Without Prior Bevacizumab Exposure and (B) After Failing Prior Bevacizumab,"Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant brain tumor. The drug pazopanib is used to treat people with a type of kidney cancer. Topotecan is used to treat lung cancer. Both topotecan and pazopanib have individually been used to treat patients with glioblastoma and some anti tumor activity has been found. Researchers want to see if these two drugs together may be able to help people with glioblastoma. Objectives: To learn if pazopanib with topotecan can help control glioblastoma. Also, to study the safety of this drug combination. Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old whose glioblastoma has returned after treatment. Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) For these, participants lay in a machine that takes pictures. Chest CT scan or x ray Heart electrocardiogram (EKG) A questionnaire about quality of life Participants will be assigned to a study group. Participants will take the study drugs for 28 day cycles for up to 1 year. They will take capsules of topotecan by mouth once every day. They will take tablets of pazopanib by mouth once every day. Participants will write in a diary the times they take the study drugs. Participants will have several study visits during each cycle. These may include Blood pressure measurement Blood and urine tests EKG Physical exam and,or neurological exam Brain MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease A symptom questionnaire At the end of treatment, participants will have a physical exam. They may have blood drawn. Participants will have follow up calls once every 3 months to check.","Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. With optimal treatment,consisting of focal radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, median survival is 14.6 months. Most patients have evidence of tumor progression within one year of diagnosis despite treatment. At progression, treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective.. Recently, bevacizumab was approved for recurrent GBM patients who fail bevacizumab indicate a short survival, on the order of 10 weeks, an approximate PFS 3 and 6 months of 0%.. Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR), Platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c Kit, and was recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma.. Topotecan is an orally bioavailable topoisomerase I and Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF 1) alpha inhibitor with reasonably high central nervous system (CNS),cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Recent pre clinical reports have begun to argue for the clinical testing of metronomic chemotherapy administration in various cancers. The theory of improved activity of Pazopanib + Topotecan administered metronomically is based on targeting tumor vasculature (both existing capillary endothelial cells and circulating bone marrow derived endothelial cell precursors), immune modulation, as well as tumor cell HIF 1 alpha inhibition, and the induction of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Further support for the combination comes from recent data tying drug induced VEGF inhibition to the induction of HIF 1 alpha activity in GBM suggesting possible synergy between Pazopanib and Topotecan. The combination of Topotecan and Pazopanib has been directly demonstrated as active in animal models Objectives 6 month progression free survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) patients with no prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group A).. 3 month progression free survival rate for rGBM patients with prior bevacizumab exposure treated with pazopanib and topotecan (Group B).

NCT03321513,DRCR.Net Aflibercept vs. Bevacizumab + Deferred Aflibercept for the Treatment of CI DME,"Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME. In eyes with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eyes response to bevacizumab treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity. If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients, clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.

Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most usual form (80 85%) of lung cancers. Unfortunately, at the time of diagnosis, most patients present with metastatic or advanced disease. Significant advances have been made in recent years on knowledge of oncogenesis of NSCLC in particularly the discovery of specific oncogenic drivers playing key role in oncogenic addiction responsible for the occurrence of NSCLC. ROS1 translocation is found in1 to 2 % of non small cell lung cancer. Due to this rare subtype of cancer, we have few datas.

NCT01331525,The Addition of Ipilimumab to Carboplatin and Etoposide Chemotherapy for Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,This trial will investigate the addition of an antibody (Ipilimumab) to conventional Carboplatin and Etoposide chemotherapy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The primary objective is to establish the progression free survival at 1 year.,"A Phase II trial of the addition of Ipilimumab to Carboplatin and Etoposide chemotherapy for the first line treatment of extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ICE) Indication: Extensive Stage Small cell lung cancer Primary Objective: To establish the progression free survival at 1 year in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with ipilimumab, carboplatin and etoposide. Secondary Objective: To assess the response to and toxicity of the combination of ipilimumab with carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. Immunological Objectives: To examine whether ipilimumab stimulates a humoral immune response to onco neuronal self antigens The results from the above measurement of antibodies against onco neuronal antigens will be used to focus the cellular biomarker analysis and identify targets to assess cellular responses: To measure the effect of ipilimumab on CD8+ T cells directed against onco neuronal antigens, presumed to be responsible for the desired cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.. To evaluate the immune response to non neuronal antigens in the presence of ipilimumab. Rationale: Small cell lung cancer accounts for around 20% of all lung cancer presentation in the UK. Of these approximately half present with extensive disease, overall representing 4000 new cases annually. Although initial response to chemotherapy for this group of patients ranges from 50 60% 1, 2, subsequent relapse is inevitable and results in poor survival with only 5% of patients alive at 2 years from diagnosis. Despite attempts to improve on conventional chemotherapy with platinum and etoposide in extensive stage small cell lung cancer, neither modification of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, nor the use of novel targeted therapy has shown an increased benefit. A conceptual change in therapeutic strategy is therefore required, and immunotherapy is an attractive avenue to pursue. Anti CTLA4 antibody may allow the development or induction of anti tumour immunity even in the absence of a known tumour antigen and without active anti tumour vaccination. Chemotherapy effectively kills tumour cells and releases tumour derived antigens and as such administration of anti CTL4 antibody may induce a clinically useful anti tumour immune response against these antigens. This trial will therefore investigate the addition of the anti CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab to conventional carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Trial Design: Single stage non randomised phase II trial Sample size: Patients will be recruited so that 40 patients are treated with chemo immunotherapy. If 8 or more patients are progression free at 1 year the treatment will be considered to be successful and warrant further testing. Study Population: All patients consented will form the ITT population. • Patients who have received at least 1 dose of Ipilimumab will form the analysis population (N=40). Dosage Regimen,Duration of Treatment: Subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy according to response and toxicity. Carboplatin will be administered at a dose of AUC = 6 (calculated according to the Calvert formula using a Cockcroft and Gault calculation of creatinine clearance) IV, day 1. Etoposide will be administered at 120mg,m2 IV day 1, 100mg BD PO days 2 and 3. Both chemotherapy drugs will be delivered as a 21 day cycle (q21) with up to a maximum of 6 cycles delivered according to response unless progressive disease (RECIST) and or excessive toxicity. Ipilimumab will be administered at a dose of 10mg,kg IV on day 1 of cycles 3 6 of chemotherapy. In the absence of immune related progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity, subsequent maintenance doses of ipilimumab will be delivered every 12 weeks starting at week 30 at a dose of 10 mg,kg until unacceptable toxicity or immune related disease progression. Tumour assessments: Tumour assessments by CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed at baseline and the following time points until progression: Weeks 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 52 and then 12 weekly until progression by both RECIST and immune related response criteria. Duration of study: It is expected that with the current standard of care the trial will take 24 months to recruit with completion of the trial anticipated in 3 years. The study may however continue for longer if patients are continuing to receive maintenance ipilimumab, in which case the study will finish 100 days after the last dose of ipilimumab (when it is clear the last dose has been given) or when all patients have died. Safety monitoring: Given the different safety profile of ipilimumab and carboplatin , etoposide chemotherapy, no overlapping toxicity is expected. However, throughout the trial, there will be a close monitoring of the nature and the severity of the adverse events reported on an on going basis. A planned interim safety monitoring assessment will be performed. Once 9 patients have been treated with the combination for at least 6 weeks (subjects who discontinued treatment earlier due to excessive toxicity of chemo immunotherapy will also be considered), a first clinical safety assessment will be performed to identify any early safety signals from ipilimumab given in combination with carboplatin and etoposide. In addition a review of safety may be triggered throughout the trial: If greater than or equal to 40% of subjects treated develop a greater than or equal to Grade 3 toxicity thought to be related to the study drugs; or If greater than or equal to 10% of subjects experience an unexpected ipilimumab related greater than or equal to Grade 3 toxicity that cannot be alleviated or controlled by appropriate care and,or steroid and,or infliximab therapy within 14 days of the initiation of such therapy. In response to any ipilimumab related deaths unless attributed to disease progression. In these circumstances the data will be carefully reviewed to determine the appropriate course of action, which could include: Continue without modification; Continue with modifications of the study protocol. Modifications may include, but are not limited to, changes in inclusion,exclusion criteria, frequency of safety monitoring, change in ipilimumab dose, and alterations in study procedures; Discontinue the study (with provisions for orderly discontinuation in accordance with good medical practice) under extreme circumstances (eg, insufficient benefit to risk effect of the experimental treatment). The decision to put patient accrual on hold while reviewing safety data will be taken or not, based on characteristics of the serious adverse events reported on an ongoing basis. The review will take into account the known toxicity profile for ipilimumab and for carboplatin,etoposide, and the potential association of immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) with clinical efficacy.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Small cell lung cancer, Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, CTLA 4, Ipilimumab",At 1 year from entering trial,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,Ipilimumab

Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is limited. The study will test carboplatin in combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR. Rationale: The present study is built upon the data from the described studies, incorporating cetuximab into a regimen of single agent carboplatin. Previous data suggest that single agent carboplatin is active in NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti EGFR agent cetuximab to carboplatin will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB,IV NSCLC.

Extensive stage SCLC comprises two thirds of new cases and is generally considered sensitive to chemotherapy, despite a median time to progression of 4 months. SCLC is one of the most aggressive and lethal types of cancer, with a median survival of 9 months (range 7 11 months) in patients diagnosed with extensive disease. Overall, the majority of patients with SCLC die in less than 2 years (2 year survival rates generally less than 10%), and the 5 year survival rate is 2.3% for patients with extensive disease. The regimen of etoposide in combination with a platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) is generally considered the standard of care although a recent Phase III trial suggests improved survival with the combination of cisplatin,irinotecan. Further evaluation of new agents in combination regimens attempting to overcome the intrinsic drug resistance seen in extensive stage SCLC is warranted attempting to improve survival and achieve palliation of disease related symptoms.",We are proposing a novel combination of bendamustine plus irinotecan followed by the standard regimen of etoposide with carboplatin.

NCT00321334,Survival Study of Docetaxel and Carboplatin as Neo Adjuvant Vs Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Stage NSLC,The objective of the trial is to determine whether 3 cycles of TP (docetaxel plus cisplatin) after complete operation will improve survival when compared with 3 cycles of TP prior to complete resection for NSCLC.,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers diagnosed worldwide. Surgical resection offers the best chance for cure for those patients diagnosed with early stage disease, however, the vast majority of patients experience eventually relapse or metastasis. The rationale of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage NSCLC lies in the possibility of eradicating micro metastasis disease, so it appears to improve survival by reducing the occurrence of distant metastases. Meta analysis, CALGB 9633, JBR 10 and ANITA trials have shown postoperative (adjuvant) CT after complete resection will prolong survival. On the other hand, Depierre et al had conducted a trial to demonstrate preoperative (neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC appears to improve survival. We need a head to head trial to comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy to answer which treatment model is better to early stager NSCLC. Based on proven activity and survival benefit in advance NSCLC, docetaxel has been introduced into neoadjuvant therapy, even as a potential option in adjuvant setting.

NCT00025272,Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan, carboplatin, and etoposide in treating patients who have extensive stage small cell lung cancer.","OBJECTIVES: Determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose of sequential topotecan, carboplatin, and etoposide in patients with chemotherapy naive extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

NCT00687297,Study of Vandetanib Combined With Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"It has been shown in previous studies that the ability to treat lung cancer could be significantly improved by not only targeting the tumor cells directly with chemotherapy, but also by cutting off the blood supply to the cancer cells. Blood vessels that supply the tumor are formed through a process called angiogenesis. Vandetanib is an investigational drug that acts by producing what is called an anti angiogenic effect. An Anti angiogenic effect is able to inhibit the development of new blood vessels required by tumors to survive by blocking the growth factors needed to form new blood vessels. The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of vandetanib to a standard chemotherapy regimen will slow or stop the growth of the cancer for a longer period of time compared to the time period generally gained from the use of standard chemotherapy alone","Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer related mortality in the United States, with an estimated 160,390 deaths in 2007. Over 80% of these patients will have non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the majority of these patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Patients with advanced disease who have an adequate performance status clearly benefit from systemic chemotherapy, and many clinical trials have been carried out to determine the most effective regimen. Comorbidities associated with NSCLC preclude the use of cisplatin in doublet therapies, and, a meta analysis comparing platinum based doublet regimens to non platinum based, third generation regimens revealed that survival outcomes between these regimens were equivalent. Despite poor response and overall survival benefits in this patient population with accepted treatment doublets, the addition of a third cytotoxic agent did not improve survival and demonstrated increased toxicity. Therefore, it appears a threshold maximum response can be gained with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone. However, the poor outcomes still associated with advanced NSCLC clearly demanded the need for continued improvements in treatment. It was postulated that anticancer therapy could be significantly improved by not only targeting the tumor cells directly, but also by targeting neo angiogenesis. A randomized phase II trial demonstrated a significant improvement in time to progression (TTP) in patients receiving carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab compared to chemotherapy alone. Due to life threatening and fatal hemorrhage patients with squamous cell histology, as well as those with a prior history of hemoptysis and brain metastases were excluded from all further clinical trials using bevacizumab. The definitive study of bevacizumab in NSCLC was a randomized phase III clinical trial conducted by ECOG (E4599) in which patients with advanced non squamous NSCLC received carboplatin + paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab which met the clinical endpoint of improvement in survival and led to the approval of bevacizumab in first line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC with non squamous histology. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein activation leads to TK activation and results in cell proliferation, motility, adhesion, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis. The EGFR is over expressed in many solid tumors, including non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and multiple studies have suggested a shortened survival in NSCLC patients whose tumor over expresses EGFR . Although studies using small molecule TK inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC did not meet efficacy endpoints, a phase III trial demonstrated the benefit of EGFR TKI monotherapy. Patients with advanced NSCLC who have received 2 or 3 prior therapies were randomized to erlotinib or placebo, and those receiving erlotinib demonstrated a survival benefit that led to FDA approval of this drug in 2004. The studies above clearly demonstrated a benefit to combining anti angiogenic factors with chemotherapy, and as a monotherapy using anti EGFR agents, in patients with advanced NSCLC. The potential benefit to simultaneously targeting these 2 pathways has been addressed in the recurrent disease setting. Vandetanib is a novel oral molecule (anilinoquinazoline) that has dual activity against both the VEGFR and EGFR pathways. Specifically, this compound has potent and reversible inhibitory activity against VEGFR 2 (KDR), VEGFR 3 (Flt 4), EGFR and RET . Vandetanib is a TKI and thus acts through inhibition of ATP binding to the tyrosine kinase domains of these receptors. Recombinant enzyme assays have demonstrated that vandetanib is highly selective for both VEGFR 2 (IC50=40 nm) with only slightly lower affinity for VEGFR 3 (2.7 fold). EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited with an IC50=500 nm. The results of a second line setting phase II trial were presented by Heymach et al at the ASCO meeting in 2006. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel alone, or docetaxel with either 100mg or 300mg of vandetanib. Patients with squamous cell histology, controlled brain metastases and prior history of hemoptysis were allowed on study. The primary endpoint of prolongation of progression free survival (PFS) was met in the 100mg arm (Hazard Ratio(HR) 0.64, p=0.07). There was no increased incidence of hemoptysis in patients receiving vandetanib, and no CNS hemorrhage events were observed, and side effects commonly attributed to EGFR inhibition (rash, diarrhea) were higher on the 300mg arm. Early combination studies suggest that in patients with NSCLC, vandetanib is safe in combination with chemotherapy, may improve the outcomes of chemotherapy when used at the 100 mg dose, and has activity as monotherapy at the 300mg dose. In addition, none of the observed hemorrhagic complications seen with bevacizumab were observed, even in patients at high risk for this complication. In this study, our main goal is to study the combination of docetaxel + carboplatin and vandetanib, followed by a double blind randomized assignment to maintenance therapy with vandetanib 300 milligrams (mg) or placebo by mouth daily until disease progression to determine if maintenance therapy can prolong progression free survival. In addition to clinical efficacy outcomes we will monitor for safety and tolerability, as well as explore any differences in outcome based on age and gender.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Stage IIIB Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Stage IV Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Vandetanib, Docetaxel plus carboplatin",Assessed every 2 cycles (1 cycle = 3 weeks during induction and 4 weeks during maintenance)),Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Lung Cancer, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","vandetanib induction, Docetaxel, Carboplatin, Placebo, Vandetanib maintenance"

Active uncontrolled infection.. Pregnant or lactating women.. Females of childbearing potential who are unwilling to avoid pregnancy, for the duration of the study.. Presence of any underlying medical conditions which in the investigators opinion would make the patient unsuitable for treatment.. Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies other than NSCLC within the last 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or stage A low grade prostate cancer.. Patients with CNS and,or leptomeningeal metastases; unless asymptomatic and not receiving corticosteriod therapy. 4.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for phase I patients The exclusion criteria are the same as above. The inclusion criteria are the same as above except for the following groups of patients, which are allowed in the phase I study: Patients with evaluable disease only (with no measurable lesions).. Patients with one (and only one) line of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, excluding patients who had received prior platinium and,or gemcitabine.. Patients with indicator lesions in previous radiation field. Measurability of indicator lesions Measurable: The lesion can be measured accurately in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with conventional techniques or as > 10mm with spiral CT scan.. Non measurable: All other lesions including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly non measurable lesions. Lesions considered to be truly non measurable include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural,cutis,pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions.. Target Lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD is used as the reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. If there are > 10 measurable lesions, those not selected as target lesions will be considered together with non measurable disease as non target lesions.. Non target Lesions: All non measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measurable lesions over and above the 10 listed as target lesions. Measurements are not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as present or absent.. Any tumour measurement relying solely on physical examination should be verified by a second physician.. The same diagnostic imaging method must be used throughout the study to evaluate the lesions. TREATMENT PLAN 5.1 Phase I study 5.1.1 Carboplatin The starting dose of carboplatin is given at a fixed dose at a target AUC of 5 over 1 hour on day 1 in both arms of the study. Carboplatin will be given before gemcitabine in all patients. The dose is repeated every 21 days and will be calculated using the Calvert formula: Dose of carboplatin (mg) = calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) + 25 x 5 The GFR will be calculated according to the Cockroft Gault formula: GFR (ml,min) = (140  age) x body weight (in kg) , 0.81 x serum creatinine (micromol,l) For female, the correction factor is 0.85 (x calculated GFR) 5.1.2 Infusional gemcitabine Infusional gemcitabine is given at a constant rate of 10 mg,m2 per minute in all patients on days 1 and 8, the cycle is repeated every 21 days. Dose escalation is achieved by increasing the duration of infusion. The total dose of gemcitabine is re constituted in 500 ml of normal saline and infused through a peripheral or central venous line. 5.2.1 Treatment courses Prior to initiating treatment, eligible patients will be randomised to receive gemcitabine given either in the standard short 30 minutes infusion, or constant rate prolonged infusion over the duration determined in the phase I study. All patients in both arms will receive carboplatin at a dose of AUC of 5 over 1 hour. Standard arm Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 1000 mg,m2 over 30 min, day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days Study arm Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 10 mg,m2,min at MTD, day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days Supportive treatment All patients should receive pre medications to prevent nausea and vomiting according to local policy.. No prophylactic growth factors are allowed.. Growth factor is allowed only in the rescue setting, eg. prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for more than 7 days, or for febrile neutropenia. 5.2.2 Dosing in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles The next treatment cycle will begin on schedule providing • There is no evidence of tumour progression Neutrophils ~ 2 x 109,L.

Dose adjustment based on nadir count Platelets (x 109,l) ANC (x 109,l) Action ~ 25 with no bleeding and ~ 0.5 or < 0.5 for < 7 days No change < 25 or < 50 with bleeding and,or < 0.5 for > 7 days Dose reduction (see below) Any and < 0.5 and fever Dose reduction Recurrence of any of the above after 2 dose reductions Off study Adjustment based on day 22 count Platelets (x 109,l) ANC (x 109,l) Action ~ 100 and > 2.0 Proceed with next cycle < 100 and,or < 2.0 Delay 1 week Maximum delay of 2 weeks (next cycle must start by day 35 to remain on study) Dose reduction schema First Reduction Second reduction Third reduction Carboplatin AUC 4.5 AUC 4.0 Off study Gemcitabine (standard arm) 750 mg,m2 (1000 mg,m2 x 75%) 500 mg,m2 (1000 mg,m2 x 50%) Off study Infusional Gemcitabine 75% of Phase II duration 50% of previous infusion duration Off study 5.2.3.3 Dose modifications for non haematologic toxicity Any grade 3 or 4 non haematologic toxicity, except for nausea and vomiting and fatigue and reversible transaminitis, will render patient off study. Non haematologic toxicity must be less than grade 2 before proceeding to the next cycle. If they are higher than grade 2, treatment is delayed for 1 week. Treatment may be delayed for a maximum of 2 weeks. 5.2.4 Treatment duration Responding patients will receive up to six cycles of chemotherapy. After treatment completion or withdrawal, patients may continue to receive further treatment at the discretion of their physician. Screening evaluations The following screening investigations must be performed within 28 days of day 1 of cycle 1: Complete staging and documentation of tumour status  baseline chest x ray, CT thorax, abdomen, brain and bone scan if clinically indicated. The following screening evaluations and investigations must be performed within 14 days of the first dose of therapy and includes the following: • Consent • Complete medical history, include details of symptoms, prior treatments, any residual toxicity, concomitant medical conditions and medications • Physical examinations, including documentation of all palpable lesions, vital signs, body weight and height, and KPS. • Documentation of indicator lesion(s) to include date of assessment, description of lesion site, dimensions, and type of diagnostic study to follow lesion. The same diagnostic method must be used throughout the study to evaluate a lesion. The following tests must be performed within 7 days of the first dose of therapy and includes the following: Full blood count. Serum electrolytes and liver enzymes, total calcium and magnesium. Serum pregnancy test, if applicable. Dipstick urinalysis  if dipstick is positive for protein or blood, a complete microscopic examination is required 8.3 Evaluation during treatment Prior to day 1 of each cycle • History and physical examination • Assess and record toxicities from prior course. Assign appropriate toxicity grades (see Appendix 4). • Record all medications taken since the last cycle. • Weight measurement for re calculation of body surface area and creatinine clearance • Assessment of symptoms of disease (QoL questionnaire should be given and filled by patient before assessment by investigator). Assessment of performance status. Full blood count, electrolytes and liver enzymes (if day15 levels are abnormal).. Urine dipstick analysis, if the baseline result is abnormal. Clinical tumour measurements should be obtained prior to every cycle of treatment. Radiographic tumour measurements should be obtained after every 2 cycles of treatment.. Modify dose of the next cycle if necessary (see section 5.2.3). Day 8 assessment • Full blood count Day 15 assessment • Full blood count, electrolytes and liver enzymes 8.4 Evaluation of response Patients will be evaluable for response after 2 cycles of therapy. Clinical tumour measurements should be performed prior to every cycle of treatment. Radiographic tumour measurements should be obtained after every 2 cycles of treatment. If a patient meets the response criteria (see section 7) for CR, PR or SD for the first time, another clinical and radiographic tumour assessment will be performed 4 or more weeks later to document that the response has lasted at least 4 weeks. Clinical tumour assessment after every cycle and radiographic tumour response after every 2 cycles will continue until completion of treatment or patient withdrawal. 8.5 Post treatment follow up Responding patients will be reviewed every 2 monthly after completion of chemotherapy. Clinical tumour assessment will be carried out 2 monthly. Radiographic tumour assessment will be done every 4 monthly. These will continue until disease progression is documented. Patients who never had a response, and patients with disease progression after a previously documented response will be followed every 3 monthly for survival data. 9. TREATMENT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL A patient will be considered as completing the treatment if: Patient has completed 6 cycles of therapy.. Patient has a confirmed CR or confirmed PR and received at least 4 cycles of therapy and the investigator does not feel further therapy is indicated.. Patient maintained a status SD for at least 8 weeks on treatment and received at least 2 cycles of treatment.. Patient has PD after completing at least one full course of treatment.. A patient is removed from the study due to unacceptable toxicity. Patients may be withdrawn from the treatment for the following reasons: Adverse experience, including intercurrent illness or unacceptable toxicity.. If attending physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the patient.. Protocol violation (including non compliance).. Patient withdrawal at his,her request, for reasons other than those above.. Lost to follow up. All patients will be followed for status of disease and survival until death. 10. QUALITY OF LIFE (QoL) ASSESSMENT It is essential to explain to the patient that the QoL assessment is an important part of the trial, and that all sections should be answered even if the patient feels them to be irrelevant. It should be emphasized that the completion of these forms helps doctors find out more about the effects of treatment on patients\ well being. A named contact person other than the responsible clinician managing the patient in the context of the trial, must be appointed to take responsibility for the administration, collection and checking of the completed EORTC QLQ C30 and QLQ LC13 questionnaire. The questionnaire must be taken before consultation with the clinician, according to the EORTC guidelines for QoL assessment. They should be checked to ensure that all questions have been answered; if necessary go back to the patient immediately and ask him or her to fill in any missing items. If an assessment is missed because of administrative failure, the patient should be contacted by telephone or letter and an arrangement should be made for the questionnaire to be taken within a week of the scheduled assessment. The questionnaire may be filled in by the patient if he,she is able to read and understand the language of the questionnaire. Otherwise, the named person for administering the QoL should read out the questions as written, in the language the patient understands, and record the response to each question without prejudicing his,her answer. The mode of delivery should be noted in the questionnaire. 11. RANDOMISATION PROCEDURE Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine given in the conventional 30 minutes infusion, or protracted infusion, both in combination with carboplatin. 11.1 Stratification Stratified randomization will be carried out using the minimization method based on the following factors: (i) Centre (National University Hospital, Sydney Cancer Centre, Johns Hopkins NUH International Medical Centre) (ii) Karnofsky performance status (90  100% vs 70  80%) (iii) Stage of disease (IIIB vs IV) 11.2 Registration Patients will be entered into the trial by a telephone call to the National Medical Research Council (NMRC) Clinical Trials & Epidemiology Research Unit (CTERU), Singapore (+65 220 1292) between 0830 to 1730 hours Monday to Friday, and 0830 to 1230 hours Saturday (Singapore time), or by Fax (+65 220 1485), stating that the patient is to be entered into the CTRG L08 or SQLU02 trial. Informed written consent for entry into the study should be obtained prior to randomization. All eligibility criteria and consent form will be checked, and the stratification factors stated before treatment is allocated. The patient will be randomized to long infusional gemcitabine (L) or 30 minute short infusion gemcitabine (S), and allocated a trial number. The design will involve equal allocation of patients to the two treatments. Confirmation fax will be sent to the investigator. 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The sample size calculation is carried out based on the statistical selection theory criterion as detailed in Simon et al (62) and Gibbons et al (63). Assuming a 90% probability of correctly selecting the best treatment, and anticipating a baseline response rate of 40%, then to detect a 15% superiority of the best treatment over the other, a trial size of 37 patients per treatment arm would be required. The total accrual target would thus be 74 patients. 13. STATISTICAL ANALYSES Statistical analysis of all study endpoints will be carried out on an intention to treat basis. In the event of lost to follow up, patients will still be included in the analysis for the duration that they are observed. The inherent comparability of results in this randomized phase II design using the statistical selection theory assures that the two treatments can be reliably ranked when large differences are obtained. The best response will be used in the analysis of objective tumour response. In the case of adverse event, where multiple events of the same kind has occurred in a patient, only the maximum grade will be documented for the analysis. The tumour response rates and toxicities between treatment groups will be compared descriptively using estimates of proportions. The response duration and time to response for responding patients will be assessed using appropriate descriptive statistics. The evaluation of progression free and overall survival will be carried out using the Kaplan Meier technique at 1 year follow up. In the case of progression free survival, patients whose disease has not progressed will be censored at the date last known to be alive. Similarly, the analysis of overall survival censors patients who are lost to follow up or who remained alive at the date last known to be alive. For each QoL dimension, changes in scores over time will be compared between treatment arms by means of appropriate graphical representation or descriptive statistics. No interim analysis is planned for this randomised phase II trial. 14. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 14.1 IRB,Ethics committee Before study initiation, the protocol will be submitted for review and approval by the hospital and Ministry of Health research and ethics committee or equivalent group. Approval of the protocol and informed consent must be obtained. 14.2 Patient information The responsible physician will inform the patient about the background and current knowledge of the treatment under study with special reference to known activity and toxicity. The patient will be told about the investigative nature of this treatment and in particular, the randomization process involved in this study. The patient will be told of his or her right to withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty with regards to the continuation of care at this institution and by the same physicians as he chooses. Before accrual, all patients will sign a written, informed consent form. 14.3 Informed consent Informed consent should meet the requirement of the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki and any applicable regulations and guidelines such as the Good Clinical Practice (Singapore). The study will be completely explained to each prospective candidate and the subject must give consent by signing and dating the consent form. Consent must be obtained before any protocol required procedures are performed, including any procedures not part of normal patient care. Plasma dFdC and dFdU levels Ten millilitres of blood will be drawn at 0 hours (baseline), 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 10 minutes before the end of the infusion, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours after the end of the infusion. The blood will be drawn into 10 ml tubes (green topped) containing heparin and 5 micromol tetrahydrouridine. The tubes are then centrifuged at 3300 rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant plasma is then transferred to plain tubes (red topped) for immediate storage at 80oC. Samples will be labeled with the patient\s name, ID number, date, exact time of sample and protocol number. A pharmacokinetic form will accompany the plasma samples to the Pharmacology laboratory in the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore, c,o Prof Lee How Sung. DFdC and dFdU levels in plasma will be measured using reverse phase HPLC, as described by Grunewald (22). Briefly, 20 microl to 50 microl of plasma is injected onto a C18 mBondapak analytical column (Waters Associates, Inc.). Components will be separated with a mobile phase consisting of a 30 minute linear gradient starting with 100% solution A (0.5M ammonium acetate, pH = 6.8) and ending with 60% solution B (50% methanol in deionised water). Flow rate is at 1.5 ml,min. Detection wavelengths are 275 nm and 262 nm for dFdC and dFdU, respectively. 16.2 Intracellular dFdCTP levels Samples of blood will be collected to assay intracellular dFdCTP. Only 3 samples per patient, obtained 10 minutes after the start and 10 minutes before the end of the infusion of gemcitabine, and one in the middle of infusion, will be assayed for dFdCTP. Plasma is first separated from the blood by centrifugation at 3300 rpm for 20 minutes. Mononuclear cells are then isolated by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are extracted with 0.4 NHClO4, and the acid insoluble material is removed by centrifugation. The supernatant is then carefully neutralized to pH 7 with potassium hydroxide, and the precipitated KClO4 is then removed by centrifugation. An ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography method is then used to separate and quantitate the dFdCTP. 17. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 17.1 Drug accountability Stocks of gemcitabine will be supplied by Eli Lilly for trial purposes, and all these vials will be accounted for at the site pharmacy. 17.2 Maintenance of patients records CTRG clinical report forms will be used to record data for this study. All patient clinical report forms will be faxed to the CTRG Office (+65 777 5545). A copy of each patients eligibility report form, randomization report form (for phase II), study schedule, consent forms, laboratory and radiological reports, and QoL assessment will be kept in the CTRG Office.

NCT00002822,Combination Chemotherapy Followed by Radiation Therapy in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer,RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug is a way to kill more tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effect of two combination chemotherapy regimens followed by radiation therapy in treating patients with small cell lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Compare the survival rate in patients with newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer and good performance status treated with an intensive regimen of ifosfamide,carboplatin,etoposide with mid cycle vincristine (VICE) vs. standard chemotherapy followed, as feasible, by thoracic radiotherapy.. Compare the adverse effects of treatment and quality of life (including psychological distress, physical status, and functional status and global quality of life) in these patients.. Compare the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist vs. the EORTC QLQ C30 and LC13 quality of life questionnaires in relation to compliance and ability to detect differences between treatments. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. The first group receives standard combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin,cyclophosphamide,etoposide (ACE) or cisplatin,etoposide (PE) every 3 weeks for 6 courses. The second group receives intensive combination chemotherapy with carboplatin,ifosfamide,etoposide on days 1 3 with vincristine on day 14 (VICE). Courses repeat every 4 weeks for 6 courses. Patients in both groups are considered for thoracic radiotherapy beginning 4 5 weeks after the first day of the last course of chemotherapy. Concurrent prophylactic antibiotics should be given. Patients who relapse may receive further treatment at the clinicians option. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for up to 1 year, every 3 months for up to 2 years, every 6 months for 5 years, and annually thereafter.

Although no prospective data support the use of EGFR TKIs as induction therapy in stage IIIA N2 NSCLC, their low toxicity profile and the possibility of a rapid tumor response suggests that prospective trials are required. Therefore, this study evaluated the value of induction erlotinib therapy in IIIA N2 NSCLC selected by EGFR gene analysis and explored a new treatment strategy for this subset. Erlotinib specifically targets the EGFR TK domain, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung, Genes, erbB 1, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Neoadjuvant Therapy",a week after completion of the induction erlotinib therapy,Non Randomized,Factorial Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung","neoadjuvant erlotinib therapy, neoadjuvant gemcitabine,carboplatin therapy"

The decision to use a regimen is currently determined by toxicity or by physicians preference. In this protocol, the treatment regimen will be assigned based on the patients tumor molecular profile. A tumor molecular profile analysis will allow the physician to define a specific molecular portrait that shows the genetic basis of the tumor. This analysis results in a detailed report that will determine which chemotherapy will be assigned to the patient.","Evaluation at study entry will include blood tests, computerized tomography (CT) scans or other types of scans needed to measure other disease sites. A biopsy of one tumor is required for tumor analysis. If the patients cancer has spread to other locations that may be easier to obtain tissue from and be less invasive, then the biopsy specimen may be collected from one of several possible locations that may exist within the patients body. These possible sites include lung, bone, liver, adrenal glands, lymph nodes, nodules under the skin, or in cases of brain involvement requiring surgery, brain tissue. Sometimes fluids build up between the lining of the lung and the lung itself. If this happened to the patient and their doctor tells them the fluid should be drained, then this fluid may also be a source of cells we can use to analyze the patients cancer. In very rare cases, other sites might be identified. Chemotherapy will consist of the assigned two drugs. Chemotherapy will be repeated every three or four weeks for at least two times. Patients will then have a CT scan to measure their tumors response. Response can be reduction of tumor size, no change of tumor size, or increased tumor size. Doing CT Scans or other tests after every two cycles of chemotherapy will assess for response. If we see a favorable response we will continue chemotherapy for a maximum of two times after the best response we can see in the patients tumor. If the patients tumor grows larger, then we discontinue the study and the patient will discuss other treatment options with their doctor.

Several studies have shown that in patients with ALK rearranged non small cells, the use of ALK inhibitors can achieve better efficacy and significantly prolong overall survival. However few of them performed Fish or NGS tests. Our data demonstrates that lung squamous cell carcinoma with ALK rearrangement responds well to ALK TKI, and correspondingly has a significant improvement in survival time and prognosis, providing a basis for the treatment of ALK positive patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma.

NCT02727335,Description of Clinical Anatomical Features and Long Term Follow up for Patients With ALK Rearrangements,Description of clinical and anatomical features and long term follow up for patients with ALK rearrangement and treated by crizotinib,"Several French studies on crizotinib have been conducted in recent years. These are not only patients treated in the PROFILE 1005 and 1007 clinical studies but also patients who have been treated with crizotinib in the named patient ATU followed by the cohort ATU (Expended Access Cohort). Under the ATU program and according to ATU regulations, a limited set of data is collected and furthermore the follow up is stopped as soon as the ATU program closes. Thus it is not possible to have access to long term data and post progression data. Our project is to collect data from the patients from the ATU program (named patient and cohort) and if possible patients treated after the marketing of crizotinib, before, during and after crizotinib therapy. Centers selected for this observational study will be those of the IFCT network that took part in the ATU program. This will allow an accurate analysis of crizotinib therapy under real life conditions. It should be emphasized that this information is generally neither available from clinical trials nor from ATU programs.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Non squamous non small cell lung cancer, crizotinib, real world study, IFCT",5 years,,,,"Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Gene Mutation",
NCT02372448,Multicenter Validation of the Sensitivity of Theranostic ALK Rearrangement Detection by FISH Analysis and Prevalence of Escaping Mutations in Circulating Tumor Cells for the Non invasive Management of Lung Cancer Patients,"Patients eligibility to targeted therapies relies on a molecular test performed on a tumor sample collected by biopsy. This invasive procedure is associated with a relative high risk of morbidity and requires the intervention of a costly and important technical platform. Thus, inoperable patients can be deprived from potentially more efficient therapies. A liquid biopsy of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) present in the blood and their molecular characterization is an appealing alternative to meet an urgent need for these patients. Moreover no CTC based molecular test is currently routinely available. The 5 year survival rate of patients with non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is low. Recent reports demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in the tumor tissue allows patients with late stages NSCLC to benefit from crizotinib treatment. However, 1) the detection of an ALK rearrangement is currently performed on small biopsies or fine needle aspirates and can be hindered by the limited tissue quantities available. Tumor tissue is difficult to obtain in patients with advanced,metastatic lung cancer for whom surgery is rarely a component of treatment. Finding alternative and more effective means of diagnosing an ALK rearrangement are critical issues for identifying patients who may benefit from treatment with crizotinib; 2) some patients develop resistance to crizotinib due to de novo ALK mutations. In this setting, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which have been shown to be detectable by ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor Cells) method in 80% to 100 % of late stages lung cancer patients represent a non invasive and easily accessible source of tumor material for assessing ALK rearrangement and escaping mutations in a kinetic manner. The ISET method was first published in 2000 and several independent teams have now established its high sensitivity and specificity of ISET for NSCLC. With ISET, specificity can be achieved using the same methods and criteria used by cytopathologists to diagnose solid tumors. The high sensitivity and specificity of ISET are two essential starting points for the feasibility of this present project. Low throughput molecular characterization of CTCs isolated by ISET has also been achieved. The remaining challenge consists in developing high throughput ISET based molecular tests for personalized medicine that are transferable to the clinics. The Team 1 at the CHU de Nice and the Team 2 at the Gustave Roussy Institute have demonstrated that the detection of an ALK rearrangement in CTC isolated by ISET is feasible and consistent with results obtained in corresponding tumor tissues. In this context, the aim of this project is to obtain 1) a definitive prospective clinical validation of the use of CTC as an alternative to tumor tissue for ALK analysis based patients stratification; 2) a proof that escaping mutations can be detected early by kinetic analysis of CTC in patients treated by crizotinib. ALK rearrangement will be prospectively investigated in CTCs isolated by ISET at diagnosis and during follow up from patients with stage IIIb,IV lung cancer and de novo mutations will be searched in patients with resistance to crizotinib. This study will provide both clinical and economic benefit to targeted treatment of patients with advanced lung cancer. This project is strongly original as no CTC based ALK rearrangement test has been independently validated up to now with clinical samples. The development of non invasive theranostic test through the genetic analysis of CTCs is a clinically relevant goal for non invasive stratification of cancer patients, avoiding morbidity related to lung biopsy and surgery. It would allow determining patient\s eligibility to targeted therapies on a blood sample analysis. CTC based ALK test could be useful to guide the choice of ALK targeted therapy in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, developing biomarkers based on CTCs analysis would open the way to the non invasive follow up of aggressive cancers, early detection of mutations associated with resistance to targeted therapies and tailoring treatment to a real time analysis of the evolving tumor cell populations. This test is expected to markedly improve patients\ quality of life avoiding invasive diagnostic procedures.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,,"at the inclusion, 6 months and 12 months",Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Diagnostic,Lung Neoplasms,ALK analysis on CTCs detected by ISET

NCT01744652,Dasatinib and Crizotinib in Advanced Cancer,The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of dasatinib and crizotinib that can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied. Dasatinib is designed to block certain proteins from causing cancer cells to grow out of control. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Crizotinib is designed to block certain abnormal genes found in cancer cells. This may cause the cancer cells to die. This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of leukemia. Crizotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of lung cancer. The combination of dasatinib and crizotinib is currently being used for research purposes only. Up to 176 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson,"Study Groups: Dose Escalation Group: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a either Arm A or Arm B based when you joined this study, the disease type, and the drugs you have taken in the past. Up to 5 dose levels of the study drug will be tested in each arm. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in each dose level of arms A and B. The first group of participants in Arm A will receive the FDA approved dose of crizotinib plus the lowest dose level of dasatinib. The first group of participants in Arm B will receive the FDA approved dose of dasatinib plus the lowest dose level of crizotinib. Each new group will receive a higher dose of the study drug combination than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found. The dose level of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have intolerable side effects. Dose Expansion Group: After the highest tolerable dose level of the study drug combination for each arm is found, up to 10 additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion group and will receive the highest dose of the study drug combination that was tolerated in the dose escalation group. Study Drug Administration: Each study cycle is 28 days. All participants will take dasatinib by mouth 1 time each day. You will take this drug alone on Day 1 of Cycle 1, before the first day you receive the study drug combination. Then starting on Day 2 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking crizotinib by mouth 1 time daily, 1 time every other day, or 2 times daily depending on the dose level of the study drug you are assigned to. You should take dasatinib and crizotinib at least 1 hour before meals. Study Visits: You will have study visits on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and again before you begin each new cycle (once every 28 days). At each study visit, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be having. Blood,Tumor Samples and Imaging Scans If you are in the dose expansion group: On Day 1 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing before your take the first dose of study drug. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.. If you are one of the first ten patients enrolled in your cohort, you will take Dasatinib only on your first day of treatment (Day 1 of Cycle 1). On Day 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood (about ½ teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before you take the drug and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after you take the drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.. If you are one of the first ten patients enrolled in your cohort, on Day 1 of Cycle 3 and beyond, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing before you take the study drug.. If you are one of the first 10 patients enrolled in your cohort, you will have a biopsy at screening and after Cycle 1. The type of biopsy you have will be based on the type of disease you have. The procedure, and its risks, will be discussed with you in more detail. All study participants: On Week 3 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.. On Day 28 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. During Week 4 of Cycle 2 and then every 2 3 cycles: You will have a CT scan, MRI scan, PET scan, and,or a bone scan to check the status of the disease. The actual type of scan you have will depend on what types of scans were taken at screening.. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure tumor markers. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions. If the disease gets worse, you may be eligible to continue taking the study drug. The study doctor will discuss this with you. Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the end of study visit.

NCT01752400,AUY922 for Advanced ALK positive NSCLC,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. Investigational means that the drug is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective for treating your type of cancer. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of cancer or for any use outside of research studies. It has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene called the ALK gene. This mutated gene helps cancer cells grow. There is a drug (crizotinib) that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with NSCLC who have mutations in the ALK gene. Most people respond to crizotinib initially. Over time, however, patients may stop responding (become resistant) to crizotinib because of additional changes in the ALK gene that makes crizotinib ineffective. AUY922 is an investigational drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that AUY922 may be effective in killing cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs like crizotinib. Only participants with changes in the ALK gene will be allowed to participate in this study. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of AUY922 and determine how well AUY922 treats participants with advanced, ALK positive NSCLC.","If you agree to participate in this research study, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These test include a medical history, physical exam, performance status, assessment of tumor, EKG, echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan, eye exam, blood draw, blood pregnancy test, urine tset and collection of a piece of stored tumor tissue. If these tests show you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study. Study treatment is given in 21 day cycles. AUY922 is given by IV (into a vein). This is called an infusion. You will receive an infusion of AUY922 jon days 1,8 and 15 of each cycle (once per week). The infusion will take about 60 minutes. A schedule of clinic visits for the study is summarized below. At every visit, you should tell the study staff how you are feeling and whether your health has changed. you may have other lab tests done as part of the the care of your cancer in addition to those listed below. Cycle 1, Day 1: physical examination, performance status, EKG, Blood draw and routine urine tests. Cycle 1, Day 2: EKG Cycle 1, Day 3: EKG Cycle 1, Day 8: measurement of weight and vital signs, performance status, EKG, questions about side effects you may have and medications you are taking Cycle 1, Day 15: physical exam, performance status, EKG, blood draw, questions about side effects you may have and medications you are taking. Note that in Cycle 1 you will need to stay at (or return to) the clinic for the last EKG following the Day 1 AUY922 infusion, and come to the clinic on Days 2 and 3 for EKGs Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 1: physical exam, performance status, EKG, blood draw, questions about side effects you may have and medications you are taking, routine urine test Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 8: measurement of weight and vital signs, performance status, EKG, questions about side effects and medications Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 15: physical exam, vital signs, performance status, EKG, blood draw, questions about side effects and medications Additional EKGs may be done at any time if your study doctor thinks it is necessary. A blood test to measure the amount of cardiac enzymes in your blood may be done whenever abnormal findings such as heart rhythm changes are suspected or seen on the EKG. CT or MRI scans will be done to measure your disease about every 6 weeks. A blood pregnancy test, for women who can become pregnant, will be performed every 6 weeks or at any point in which pregnancy is suspected. A standard eye exam will be done on Cycle 3, Day 1. Additional eye exams will be done if you experience any eye related symptoms, such as changes in vision. Within 1 week after your last dose of the study drug AUY922, you will be asked to return to the clinic for an End of Treatment Visit. At this visit the following will be done: physical examination, performance status, ECG, ECHO or MUGA scan, blood draw, urine test, eye exam, questions about side effects you may have and medications you are taking. You will be asked to return to the clinic about 3 weeks after the End of Treatment Visit (about 4 weeks after the last dose of AUY922) so we can follow up on any side effects you may still be experiencing after stopping AUY922. If you decide to stop study treatment for a reason other than progression of your disease, you will be asked to have follow up CT scans or MRIs every 12 weeks to continue to monitor the status of your cancer. If your tumors get worse, you will not need to have any further CT scans (or MRIs) as part of the study. If your disease does progress, we would like to contact you by telephone about every 3 months to check on your status. This will be done until after the last participant stops study treatment, or for as long as you allow us to contact you. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition helps us look at the long term effects of the research.

NCT02718651,Blood based Identification and Monitoring of Patients With ALK translocated Lung Cancer,"Genetic rearrangements in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene result in the creation of a variety of oncogenic fusion proteins that drive malignancy in a subset of non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) patients. Treatment with the ALK small tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib has produced remarkable results for ALK positive patients, however the current diagnostic tests used in the clinic are not sufficiently detailed and require a tumor biopsy. The aim of this study is to use a new diagnostic test to detect ALK rearrangements using next generation sequencing, which will improve the diagnosis and treatment of ALK positive NSCLC patients. Furthermore, this test will be performed on blood samples, making it minimally invasive for the patients. It is our believe that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood can be employed as an easy accessible and comprehensive source of information to diagnose ALK positive disease, but also as a means of monitoring patient response during treatment. Quantitation of the the amount of ALK rearrangement will give information about which patients benefit from treatment and when treatment is no longer effective. The project will be a multicenter study where blood samples will be collected every 6 weeks from patients treated at four major hospitals in Denmark. This study will benefit future patients with lung cancer, as it will improve both the monitoring and evaluation of their treatment. Monitoring patients during treatment will provide more knowledge of disease progression and the effect of ALK TKI treatment, contributing to a greater selection of patients, who will respond to treatment.

Subsequent or previous treatments (treatments delivered after or before dabrafeninb trametinib combination will be recorded). Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.","The braf gene (V Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, long arm of chromosome 7q3) codes for a protein (serine , threonine kinase) which regulates the signaling pathway RAS  RAF  MEK  ERK playing an important role in the proliferation processes, cell survival, angiogenesis, cell invasion and migration. When activated by mutations, BRAF phosphorylates MEK to promote cell growth, proliferation and survival. In non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRAF mutations are found in 1 2% of cases. BRAF mutations are distinguished by kinase activity and their signaling via the mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. BRAF V600 mutations, class I, signal as monomers with or without activated RAS. BRAF non V600 are classified as either class II that signal as dimmers when RAS as activated or class III with impaired kinase activity but increased MAPK pathway signaling. The most frequent mutation in NSCLC (50% of cases) is the V600E mutation (glutamate , valine substitution, codon 600 of exon 15) which is activating (others mutations: G469A and D594G, respectively 39% and 11% of cases). One phase II trial demonstrated that the dabrafenib trametinib combination had significant anti tumor activity in terms of response rate, PFS in patients with a NSCLC with the BRAF V600E mutation, pretreated or not. In this multicentre non randomized phase II open label study, a dabrafenib trametinib combination was tested in 59 previously treated patients with metastatic stage IV BRAF V600E mutated NSCLC with documented progression after at least one prior platinum based chemotherapy. Overall response rate (ORR) was 63.2% (95% CI: 49.3 to 75.6%), median PFS was 9.7 months (95%CI 6.9 19.6). In the cohort of patients previously untreated (n=36) and treated with first line dabrafenib trametinib combination, the investigator assessed confirmed ORR was 64% (95% CI 46 79 %), the median investigator assessed PFS was 10.9 months (95CI:7 16.6) and the 6 month PFS was 72% (53 84%) respectively. At the last ASCO conference 2020, the data have been updated. In cohorts of untreated and previously treated patients, the ORR was 63.9% (95CI 46.2 79.2) and 68.4% (95CI 54.8, 80.1), median PFS 10.8 months (95CI 7.0 14.5) and 10.2 months (95CI: 6.9 16.7).

The dabrafenib trametinib combination had European authorization since 2017. In January 2020, the French Transparency Committee validated its possible use in second line in current practice, after failure of a first therapeutic line (whatever its nature) but only for BRAF V600E mutations. Clinical outcomes data on BRAF mutated V600 NSCLC patients treated in routine practice by dabrafenib trametinib combination is limited with only retrospective studies including few patients.

Systemic chemotherapy in patients with metastatic EC has limited effectiveness, resulting in a median survival of 8 months to 10months. The low activity and brief duration of benefit for chemotherapy to palliate advanced disease make clear need to identify new active agents. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over expressed, and have been related to poor prognosis in patients with EC. The association between EGFR activated signaling pathways and tumor cell survival are well documented in many studies. Some EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) already showed clinical efficacy against EC. A study with erlotinib showed objective response rate of 15% (2 of 13 patients), but activity was limited to squamous cell type.8 In another study, thirty patients with malignant solid tumor were treated with BIBW2992, irreversible inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, and one of four EC patients achieved partial response. PF 00299804 is a second generation quinazoline based irreversible pan HER inhibitor. In preclinical studies, PF 00299804 has much lower IC50 values than gefitinib in cell lines engineered to express EGFRvIII mutations (1.2 nM versus 2,700 nM) and produces tumor growth inhibition in gefitinib resistant xenografts.

NCT00995761,Biweekly Schedule of Docetaxel and Cisplatin in High Risk Patients With Unresectable Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"The rationale of phase II study of biweekly docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with unresectable NSCLC are follows: First, the optimal dose and schedule of combination with docetaxel and cisplatin are still controversial (3 weekly versus weekly). Platinum based combination chemotherapy improves the survival of patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first line setting. Combination chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin is one of the standard platinum based regimens for treating NSCLC. However, usual standard 3 weekly regimen with docetaxel and cisplatin have consistently produced frequent Grade 3 4 neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia. Although weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is better tolerated than chemotherapy every 3 weeks, especially in the first line setting in terms of myelosuppression, the optimal dose and schedule for administration of the two drugs has not yet been determined. Both 3 weekly docetaxel plus cisplatin and weekly schedule showed similar response rates but had different toxicity profiles. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia in the 3 weekly schedule and fatigue or asthenia in the weekly schedule. Second, docetaxel and cisplatin have different action and mechanism. Docetaxel showed characteristic early bone marrow suppression 5 7 days after infusion compared with usual 14 days after infusion of cisplatin. Thus, nadir period is not overlapped when the investigators administered both drugs concomittantly. Third, there are many feasible reports of biweekly administration of docetaxel in patients with NSCLC, breast cancer, stomach cancer, and ovarian cancer with better safety profiles. Therefore,the investigators designed this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of biweekly schedule of docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with unresectable NSCLC and test the hypothesis that biweekly schedule of docetaxel and cisplatin is better tolerated than both standard 3 week and weekly schedule in terms of hematologic (neutropenia) and non hematologic toxicities (asthenia, interstitial pneumonitis. Additionally the investigators will evaluate polymorphism associated with this study.","Study design is followings: The sample size was calculated according to Simons two stage optimal design. Assuming a response rate of 40%, a probability of error of 5% and a power of 80%, a total of 48 patients (43 patients plus 5 patients to compensate a 10% drop out rate) were enrolled. In the initial stage, 13 evaluable patients were to be entered into the study and evaluated for their response. If ≥ 3 responses were observed during the first stage, then 30 additional patients were to be entered in the second stage. The statistical evaluation was performed based on the intention to treat analysis. The combination chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel of 40mg,m2 as a 1 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 40mg,m2 as a 30 minutes intravenous infusion and both drugs were given on days 1, and 15 in an outpatient setting. Patients also received adequate hydration with at least 1,500ml of half saline or normal saline before cisplatin administration. All the patients received antiemetic therapy that consisted of intravenous 5 HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone before docetaxel administration. The treatment cycles were repeated every 4 weeks until the maximum six cycles. The patients whose absolute neutrophil count and platelet count were greater than or equal to 1.500 and 100,000,mm3, respectively, and who had lower than or equal to grade 1 non hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia) received chemotherapy on day 1 of each cycle. On days 15 of each cycle, the minimum requirements to receive chemotherapy were an absolute neutrophil count between 1000 and 1,500,mm3, a platelet count ≥75,000,mm3 and no grade ≥2 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia). If these conditions were not met on days 1, or 15, then chemotherapy was postponed for 1 week. A delay of more than 3 weeks resulted in withdrawal from the study. If there were any grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities at the nadir of the previous cycle, or febrile neutropenia with or without documented infection, then administration of both drugs in the subsequent cycles was reduced by 25% from the planned dose. The Administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF) was allowed in the presence of febrile neutropenia, and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. In the presence of grade 3 or 4 non hematologic toxicity (except nausea, vomiting and alopecia), the treatment was postponed until resolution of the toxicity and then both drug doses were reduced by 25% for the next cycle. Treatment was stopped at any time for documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or according to the patients own refusal. The pretreatment baseline evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination, a complete blood cell count (CBC) with the differentials, chemistry profiles and performance status. Chest X rays, chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, brain CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging, a radionuclide bone scan and other diagnostic procedures were performed as clinically indicated. During treatment, a limited history taking, physical examination, assessment of toxicity, a complete blood cell count with the differentials and blood chemistry tests were repeated weekly. A chest X ray was performed every 4 weeks before each cycle. Appropriate imaging studies, including CT scans of the chest and upper abdomen, were performed every two cycles to assess the treatment response, and sooner if needed for documenting disease progression. The objective tumor responses were assessed according to the RECIST criteria. The response rate was calculated as the ratio of the number of patients who achieved a complete or partial response to the number of enrolled patients. Overall survival (OS) and Time to progression (TTP) were calculated from the start of therapy until death and progression, respectively, or until the last follow up. Toxicities were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale version 3.0.",Completed,All,18 Years,75 Years,"biweekly, docetaxel, cisplatin, non small cell lung cancer","after every 2 cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin, after every 2 cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,Docetaxel and Cisplatin

NCT00201825,A Phase II Study of Capecitabine and Docetaxel in Previously Untreated Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients,This study will determine the objective response rate in chemotherapy naive non small cell lung cancer patients with advanced disease.,"Rationale: Docetaxel has some efficacy against non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This drug is Food and Drug Administration approved in combination with cisplatin (Platinol) for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients who have not previously had chemotherapy for this condition. Docetaxel is also approved for second line treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Research indicates that capecitabine, in combination with docetaxel, has efficacy against NSCLC. Capecitabine appears to have anti cancer activity through several enzymes. This drug is metabolized in the body to another agent called 5 FU. During this conversion process, 5 FU requires thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a cellular characteristic associated with tumor growth. There are higher levels of TP expression in tumors as compared to normal tissue. The drug administration schedule in this study is designed to optimize efficacy against the TP target through both docetaxel and capecitabine. This study will measure biological changes to TP and other enzymes to help researchers gain more information about how capecitabine and docetaxel works against NSCLC. Purpose: This study will evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel and capecitabine in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC. Tests related to tumor biology will be conducted before and during study treatments and correlated with patient responses to therapies. Treatment: Patients in this study will receive docetaxel and capecitabine. Docetaxel will be administered through intravenous infusions. Capecitabine will be provided through oral pills.

Despite intensive treatment over the past several decades, the 5 year lung cancer survival rate remains a dismal 8 14%. Chemotherapy is the primary therapy to patients with stage IIIB,IV disease, and most investigators believe that treatment with a combination of two agents is the best first line treatment for stage IV NSCLC. In the late 1970s and 1980s, studies were conducted using combinations of agents. Outcomes were improved and these agents were eventually incorporated into clinical practice. Weekly docetaxel is being studied in combination with other commonly used NSCLC chemotherapeutic agents including carboplatin, navelbine, and gemcitabine. These combinations are being studied in both first and second line settings. Second line chemotherapy with docetaxel may affect survival (TAX 318, 1 year survival 37% vs. 11%). However, the optimal sequence of chemotherapy was rarely explored. Weekly docetaxel may offer better tolerability vs. 3 weekly schedule when combining docetaxel to cisplatin. Based upon these studied, we choose weekly docetaxel in combination with cisplatin as our regimen.

The safety and tolerability of this drug combination will also be studied.,"Imatinib mesylate is a medication that blocks certain proteins important in the development of cancer. Docetaxel is a drug that is designed to target and destroy cancer cells. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 4 imatinib mesylate tablets by mouth once a day. Docetaxel will be given through a vein in your arm on the first day of each treatment cycle for a total of 6 cycles. The infusion will take 1 hour. A treatment cycle on this study is 21 days. You will need to take steroids (dexamethasone) before receiving docetaxel to try to prevent fluid accumulation and hypersensitivity reactions. The dexamethasone will come in a pill form to be taken every 12 hours for 3 days starting the day before chemotherapy. You will also receive additional dexamethasone by vein before the docetaxel is given. After you complete 6 treatment cycles, you will continue to take 4 imatinib mesylate tablets each day until your cancer gets worse, or you experience unacceptable side effects, or you withdraw from the study. While on this study, you will have a physical exam every 3 weeks. During the first 5 weeks of the study, you will have blood tests each week. About 3 teaspoons of blood will be drawn each time. After the first 5 weeks, you will have blood tests (3 teaspoons each) at the beginning of each treatment cycle. In addition, your tumor will be measured by a CT or MRI scan every 6 weeks. You must agree not to use herbal remedies or other over the counter therapies (e.g., shark cartilage) during treatment. If you develop any unacceptable symptoms or changes in your laboratory tests, your treatment may be delayed and,or the dose decreased until the symptoms are gone. It may even be necessary to stop your treatment. Your doctor will inform you of any changes in your dosing schedule or in the doses of your medication after he,she evaluates you in the clinic.

NCT00066768,Suramin and Either Docetaxel or Gemcitabine in Treating Patients With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Platinum Refractory Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of suramin when given together with either docetaxel or gemcitabine in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non small cell lung cancer that is refractory to platinum chemotherapy (such as cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin). Drugs used in chemotherapy such as docetaxel and gemcitabine use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining suramin with either docetaxel or gemcitabine may reduce resistance to the drugs and kill more tumor cells.","OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of low dose suramin administered with docetaxel or gemcitabine in patients with stage IIIB or IV platinum refractory non small cell lung cancer. II. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine whether suramin plasma concentrations in combination with docetaxel or gemcitabine can be predicted by pretreatment dose calculations based on clinical parameters. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, pilot, dose finding study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive low dose suramin IV over 30 minutes and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive low dose suramin IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or partial response after the initial 3 courses optionally continue the same therapy for 3 additional courses. Patients with disease progression after 6 courses of treatment on the original arm may cross over and receive treatment on the other arm. Patients with progressive disease or stable disease after the initial 3 courses cross over to the other arm and receive treatment on that arm for 3 additional courses. Patients with responsive or stable disease after the sixth course may continue therapy on that arm. Cohorts of 6 12 patients in each arm receive doses of suramin calculated from a clinical formula validated in prior clinical trials. Adjustments on the suramin dose are performed if the initial dose is off target and less than 50 µM peak concentration. The optimal dose is defined as the dose at which at least 5 of 6 patients achieve optimal plasma concentrations of suramin and no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and 22) with docetaxel 75 mg,m2 and cisplatin 75 mg,m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy (weekly docetaxel cisplatin, 20 mg,m2) and 3 D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy,5 fractions per week,2 Gy per fraction). ). The primary endpoint is the response rate. Secondary objectives are toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival.","Lung cancer is the most common malignancy among men in most countries and constitutes the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Non small cell histology represents roughly 80% of lung cancer cases comprising one third of patients with stage III, locally advanced disease at diagnosis. Some stage IIIA cancers are considered resectable but many stage IIIA (with bulky N2) and stage IIIB (T4 any N M0, any T N3M0) cancers are considered unsuitable for surgery. However, some authors have shown that surgery after chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is beneficial for at least progression free survival (PFS). Since the 90s, CHRT has become the cornerstone of inoperable locally advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A meta analysis of 52 randomized studies showed a survival improvement of 3% at 2 years and 2% at 5 years for patients treated with CHRT versus radiotherapy alone 6. Concomitant chemoradiation was demonstrated to be better than sequential administration in terms of overall survival (OS) in 3 out of 4 randomized studies with esophagitis as the dose limiting toxicity. Nevertheless, the median survival was around 16 months and improvement is needed. To better control micrometastatic disease and reduce distant relapses, one possibility is to increase radiosensitization with higher doses of chemotherapy.The aim of this phase II study is to evaluate the anti tumoral activity of a weekly docetaxel cisplatin combination administered concurrently with radiotherapy after 2 induction cycles with the same drugs.",Completed,All,18 Years,75 Years,"Concurrent 3 D chemoradiotherapy,Docetaxel,Cisplatin,Chemotherapy ·",up to 3 years,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Locally Advanced Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"Docetaxel, concomitant radiotherapy, Cisplatin"

The main endpoint is to compare the overall response rate (ORR) of MK 3475 with docetaxel or docetaxel alone in patients with advanced NSCLC.,"MK 3475 (MK 3475) is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody to PD1, which received a breakthrough therapy designation for advanced melanoma from the FDA in January 2013. Preliminary results from the NSCLC cohort of a phase I dose expansion trial of MK 3475 were presented at the 2013 World Conference on Lung Cancer meeting. MK 3475 was administered intravenously every three weeks, and continued until disease progression based upon immune related response criteria (irRC) or unacceptable toxicity. IrRC take into account the potential for different patterns of response that can be seen with immunotherapy. Of the 38 patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC evaluable for efficacy, 9 (24 percent) achieved at least partial response by irRC. Standard oncology criteria for response (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, RECIST were available for 33 of these patients, with at least a partial response in seven patients (21 percent). Median overall survival was 51 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated, with one case of pneumonitis (grade 2) and one case of pulmonary edema (grade 3) reported. Tumor PDL1 expression (assessed with a different assay than that used for the trials evaluating Nivolumab and MPDL3280A; antibody used undisclosed) was available for 33 of the patients who had irRC assessments and 29 of those with standard oncology (RECIST) assessment. Of the 9 patients with PDL1 positivity and irRC response data, 6 achieved at least partial response (67 percent); of the 7 patients with PDL1 positivity and standard oncology response data, 4 achieved response (57 percent).

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

NCT03449901,"ADI PEG 20 in Combination With Gemcitabine and Docetaxel for the Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma, Osteosarcoma, Ewings Sarcoma, and Small Cell Lung Cancer","The investigators have recently demonstrated that argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) expression is silenced in 88% of all sarcomas (n=708), and that this loss is associated with a decreased overall survival. Using the extracellular arginine depleting enzyme PEGylated arginine deiminase (ADI PEG20), an extracellular arginine depleting enzyme, the investigators demonstrated ADI PEG20 induces a prosurvival metabolic reprogramming in ASS1 deficient sarcomas that redirects glucose into the serine,folate pathway directing the carbons from glucose into pyrimidine biosynthesis, thus sensitizing cells to death by the pyrimidine antimetabolite gemcitabine by using metabolomics. The synthetic lethality was increased by the addition of docetaxel. Therefore a phase II clinical trial of ADI with gemcitabine and docetaxel, a standard second line therapy for soft tissue sarcoma will be conducted to determine if the clinical benefit rate of gemcitabine and docetaxel is improved by the metabolic changes induced by ADI PEG20. Recently published data shows that priming ASS1 deficient tumors with ADI PEG 20 and docetaxel improves the effect of gemcitabine.

According to the World Health Organizations Global Cancer Observatory, there were an estimated 2.09 million new cases and 1.76 million deaths worldwide in 2018 (GLOBOCAN, 2018, Fact Sheet N⁰39). The lung cancer incidence and mortality in China is relatively high compared to most countries with an estimated 774,323 new cases and 690,567 deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN, 2018, Fact Sheet N⁰160 China). In the US, as per the estimates of the National Cancer Institute, there would be about 228,820 new cases and 135,720 deaths from lung cancer in 2020 accounting for approximately 22.4% of all cancer deaths (SEER program, 2020). About 84% of lung cancers are NSCLCs in the US (American Cancer Society, 2020). The prognosis for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, either at initial diagnosis or recurrence, remains grim. The standard of care has been chemotherapy with agents including platinum analogs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and pemetrexed with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and for patients with appropriate disease genotypes, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. First line Therapy: For patients without specific molecular target, first line therapy is usually a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD 1) inhibitor or a platinum containing, double agent regimen. Platinum can be either cisplatin or carboplatin, and the most commonly used drugs combined with platinum include paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine; other drugs such as irinotecan, etoposide, and vinblastine. The arrival of immunotherapy with the PD 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab effectively changed the first line standard. Pembrolizumab is very effective, with a long Duration of Response (DoR), however response rates remain suboptimal (approximately 45% in first line Keytruda® Prescribing Information. 2020). Most patients will eventually fail first line therapy and docetaxel remains a valid treatment option when NSCLC patients fail to respond to targeted or immune based therapies or become refractory to such therapies. For patients intolerant to platinum containing regimens, platinum free double agent chemotherapy regimens are used as an alternative. For patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 2 and elderly patients, single agent or double agent regimens are recommended. Approval has been obtained in China for the single agent gefitinib to be used in first line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with sensitive mutation of EGFR tyrosine kinase gene. Second line Therapy: Drugs used for second line treatment include docetaxel, pemetrexed, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR mutant patients, and the checkpoint inhibitors (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab). Several second line treatment drugs and regimens (docetaxel, pemetrexed, and ramucirumab combined with docetaxel) have been approved as single agents or combination for second line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR wild type with limited efficacy, characterized by limited clinical improvement or overall survival (OS). EGFR wild type represents around 85% of western NSCLC population, and around 70% of Asian NSCLC population. Checkpoint inhibition with PD 1,programmed death ligand 1 (PD L1) inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy or other checkpoint inhibitors have moved into first line and are increasingly not an option for 2nd,3rd line. This has created a situation where docetaxel based regimens have become standard of care in 2nd,3rd line NSCLC. Therefore, the evaluation of plinabulin combined with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone has become highly relevant. Docetaxel, a taxane, binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G2,M phase and subsequent cell death. In patients with NSCLC, previously treated with a platinum based chemotherapy, second line therapy with docetaxel afforded a median OS in the range from 5.7 to 7.5 months (Fossella, 2000; Shepherd, 2000). The most common AEs included infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia (FN), hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia (Taxotere Prescribing Information, 2020). Since the approval of docetaxel in 1999 as the second line treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, other drugs, namely pemetrexed and erlotinib, have been approved for the same indication. However, despite the availability of newer treatments, patient survival has not improved over that achieved with docetaxel. The OS in these studies was found to remain in the range of 5.6 to 8.3 months (Hanna et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2008; Shepherd et al., 2005). A retrospective analysis of the plinabulin Phase 2 study suggests that plinabulin prolongs survival in NSCLC patients with measurable lung tumors. The expectation is that patients with a measurable lung lesion may still harbor antigens that are immunogenic, thus capable of still stimulating the immune system. Docetaxel treatment is expected to release these immunogens and plinabulin is expected to enhance presentation of these immunogens via dendritic cell activation, to the T cell repertoire. This plinabulin study investigates the efficacy and safety of plinabulin and docetaxel combination in patients with EGFR wild type NSCLC and progressing tumors requiring second or third line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease after failing a platinum containing regimen. The primary endpoint is OS, with docetaxel monotherapy as an active comparator.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,Mid February 2021 (Approximately 2 years after study initiation),Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Docetaxel + Plinabulin (DP), Docetaxel (D)"

NCT01059188,Neo adjuvant Treatment in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),"RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving cetuximab together with cisplatin and docetaxel before radiation therapy and cetuximab followed by surgery and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB non small cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery.","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant sequential chemoimmunotherapy comprising cetuximab, cisplatin, and docetaxel before radiotherapy and cetuximab followed by surgery in patients with resectable stage IIIB non small cell lung cancer.

NCT00066885,Study of DN101 and Taxotere in Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"This Phase 1,2 clinical trial is a multi center, open label study with three main objectives. The first (Phase 1A) is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of DN 101 when administered in combination with Taxotere (docetaxel) every three weeks (closed). The second is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of DN 101 when administered weekly in combination with Taxotere(docetaxel)devery three weeks (open). The third is to evaluate the safety and objective tumor response rate of the combination in NSCLC. DN 101 doses will be escalated at three dosing levels. Patients will receive oral DN 101 on day one, followed by intravenous docetaxel on day two of a 21 day cycle. Treatment cycles will be repeated at the same dose level each 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","DN 101 is an oral anti cancer therapy for solid tumors and various hematologic malignancies. DN 101 is a unique formulation of calcitriol specifically designed for use in cancer. Calcitriol is a naturally occurring hormone and the most potent biologically active form of vitamin D. In high doses, calcitriol is active in many laboratory and animal models of cancer and synergistic with many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Until recently, the clinical use of calcitriol as an anti cancer therapy was limited by hypercalcemia at doses required for anti tumor activity. Based upon clinical results to date, Novacea believes it has successfully developed a solution to this problem through development of DN 101. Chemotherapy for NSCLC, while not curative, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with unresectable disease. A number of different chemotherapy agents have been shown to have single agent activity in NSCLC. These include cisplatin, carboplatin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel. For first line therapy of Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC, these agents are generally used in combination. In most cases, first line chemotherapy consists of a platinum based agent, either cisplatin or carboplatin, and another chemotherapeutic.

NCT00256789,Once Weekly Radiation for Lung Cancer With Chemotherapy,"This program is designed for the treatment of patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer. The study is designed for patients whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. Patients at this stage of their disease traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both treatments in succession. Recently, the administration of both methods of treatment has been employed and preliminary studies indicate somewhat better results. Specifically, a new class of chemotherapy agents called taxanes used in combination with radiation therapy appear promising as determined in small studies. However, the best treatment for this type of cancer has not been established yet. One goal of this study is to investigate if the combination of the new drug Taxotere (a drug belonging to the taxane class) given on the day of the radiation is well tolerated and will result in enhanced shrinkage of the cancer compared to traditional radiation therapy. In this study the radiation will be given on one day, rather than divided over five days per week (Monday through Friday) as in previous studies. Previous research has shown that both equal in how effective they are in treating lung cancer. The study will use the drug Taxotere in conjunction with radiation therapy. Taxotere is an approved medicine by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the chemotherapy drug Taxotere administered once weekly together with concurrent radiation on the same day is effective in shrinking non small cell lung cancer. This trial will also investigate how well this treatment is tolerated and what effects this treatment will have on the everyday life and activities of participants.","40 patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled (stages III and IV) and treated once per week for a total of 12 cycles (12 weeks) according to the schedule outlined below. Chemotherapy: The suggested phase II dose for weekly Taxotere with concomitant standard chest radiotherapy was determined to be 20mg,m2. In our unpublished phase I clinical trial, we found 35 mg,m2 to be well tolerated and therefore this dose is chosen for this phase II study. The drug will be administered intravenously on the same day as the radiation. All patients will be premedicated 12 hours prior to chemotherapy with Decadrone. Patients will be followed and evaluated weekly by a physician. Radiation therapy: Although radiation was delivered differently in previous Taxotere based combined modality studies, the total radiation dose remains the same. Treatment will be given to a large field with a 2 3 cm tumor margin. All involved or suspicious nodal areas will be radiated as well. To reduce volume toxicity, the field within a field technique will be employed. Tumor and involved nodes will receive 200 cGy + 300 cGy. A total of 12 treatments will be administered in weekly, single sessions. Total treatment will be 6000 cGy.

Oral vinorelbine will be used in the present study rather than the intravenous form because: 1 Previous investigations have demonstrated that oral vinorelbine is as effective as the intravenous form in the treatment of NSCLC. 2  We think that the use of oral agents in CT will reduce some disagreements provoked by intravenous injections: stress, infections, hemorrhage, displacement at the hospital and cost of CT. .","About one third of patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have inoperable, locally advanced stage III disease at diagnosis. The most satisfactory treatment for patients with locally advanced NSCLC is combination chemotherapy radiotherapy (CT RT). However, the optimal interval between irradiation and chemotherapy as well as the most effective chemotherapy protocol remains to be defined. Our aim is to conducted a multicenter phase II trial of the cisplatin oral vinorelbine radiotherapy combination after induction chemotherapy with cisplatin docetaxel in patient with NSCLC. Oral vinorelbine will be used in the present study rather than the intravenous form because: 1 Previous investigations have demonstrated that oral vinorelbine is as effective as the intravenous form in the treatment of NSCLC. 2  We think that the use of oral agents in CT will reduce some disagreements provoked by intravenous injections: stress, infections, hemorrhage, displacement at the hospital and cost of CT. Patients will be enrolled in the study by members of GFPC, a French cooperative group on thoracic oncology. The main eligibility criteria are : histologically or cytologically documented inoperable stage IIIA N2 or IIIB NSCLC previously untreated, absence of malignant pleural effusion, performance status (PS) =1 and patient life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

NCT00069160,"Tariquidar and Docetaxel to Treat Patients With Lung, Ovarian, Renal and Cervical Cancer","The purpose of this study is three fold: 1) to examine the ability of the experimental drug tariquidar to improve chemotherapy results by blocking a protein (P glycoprotein) on some cancer cells that acts to pump out cancer drugs; 2) examine how tariquidar interacts with the cancer drug docetaxel; and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment with tariquidar and docetaxel in treating patients with lung, ovarian, or cervical cancer. Patients 18 years of age and older with recurrent or metastatic (spreading) lung, cervical, or ovarian cancer who cannot benefit from any standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination; review of pathology slides; blood and urine tests; imaging tests, including computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; chest x ray, electrocardiogram (EKG); and possibly echocardiogram. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures: Blood draw. Blood is drawn before treatment begins to establish baseline levels for future blood tests. Blood counts are done twice weekly after chemotherapy begins. Central venous catheter placement. A plastic tube is put into a major vein in the chest. It is used to give the study drugs or other medications, including antibiotics and blood transfusions, if needed, and to withdraw blood samples. The line is usually placed under local anesthesia in the radiology department or the operating room. It can stay in the body for months or be removed after each treatment is completed. Chemotherapy. Treatment cycles are 21 days. Both drugs are given on day 1 of each cycle. First, tariquidar is given as a 30 minute infusion. One hour after the tariquidar infusion, docetaxel is infused over 1 hour. (For the first cycle only, docetaxel is given in divided doses one week apart and tariquidar is administered on either day 1 or day 8. The order of tariquidar administration is randomized to generate optimal pharmacokinetic data. Patients will be hospitalized for several days during this cycle to gather research data). The tariquidar dose remains the same throughout the study. Docetaxel may be increased or decreased from cycle to cycle, based on side effects.","Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance remain major obstacles in the treatment of cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that in some malignancies P glycoprotein (Pgp) can confer resistance, and that its reversal can improve therapeutic outcome. Clinical trials investigating Pgp antagonists have been hampered by the occurrence of unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions, which have required dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic agents to avert excessive toxicity. Tariquidar (XR9576) is a new Pgp antagonist that is more potent and has prolonged activity. Phase I trials with paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and docetaxel have demonstrated that tariquidar (XR9576) has minimal pharmacokinetic interactions while surrogate studies have confirmed in vivo inhibition of Pgp mediated drug transport.This study seeks to determine the pharmacokinetic interaction, if any between docetaxel and tariquidar and to evaluate the potential for activity in lung, ovarian, primary peritoneal, fallopian tube and cervical cancers.

One third of all non resectable advanced NSCLC patients in second line do not receive chemotherapy treatment at all. In the absence of treatment the Progression Free Survival (PFS) for NSCLC patients is dismal, in the range of 6 8 weeks, and treatment only modestly improves the median PFS to 10 11 weeks. Therefore, because of an overall poorer prognosis for patients with advanced NSCLC, development of new agents is urgently needed. AXL1717 is a small molecule experimental product developed by Axelar AB as anticancer agent for oral administration. AXL1717 inhibits the insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1), which is often over expressed in lung tumors and can mediate the proliferation of lung cancer cells and resistance to therapy. Results of previous preclinical and clinical studies indicate that AXL1717 will be tolerable and effective in patients with previously treated, advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) histological subtypes of NSCLC. This is an open label, randomized, multi center, Phase II study to investigate AXL1717 compared to docetaxel in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) of the lung. Patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic SCC or AC subtypes of NSCLC in need of additional treatment will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized to either AXL1717 or to docetaxel group as monotherapy, in a 3:2 ratio for each NSCLC subtype. Patients in AXL1717 group will receive 400 mg AXL1717 twice daily (BID) as oral suspension for 21 days per cycle; i.e. daily for up to four cycles unless a dose interruption, delay, or reduction is required.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that have not responded to standard therapy or for which there is no effective therapy.,"OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of liver dysfunction in these patients on the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this therapy. III. Determine the utility of indocyanine green clearance and lidocaine metabolism as indicators of hepatic elimination of docetaxel in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to liver function (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Within each abnormal liver function stratum, cohorts of 3 6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Within each abnormal liver function stratum, more than 6 patients are treated at the MTD, if possible. Patients in the normal liver function stratum are included as control patients and are followed for toxicity, but do not undergo dose escalation. Patients are followed for survival.

NCT00096707,Dose Escalation Trial of 2 Deoxy D Glucose (2DG) in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors,"The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and biologic effect (FDG PET, preliminary efficacy) of daily oral doses of 2DG with and without weekly docetaxel in subjects with advanced solid tumors.","2 deoxy D glucose (2DG) is a synthetic glucose analog under development by Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that exploits the differences in metabolism between normal and malignant cells. Malignant cells utilize glucose at a much higher rate than normal cells and are therefore more dependent on aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. If glycolysis could be blocked preferentially in malignant cells, 2DG would have potential for anti tumor therapy. Hypoxic cells are especially dependent on anaerobic glycolysis and are generally resistant to anti tumor therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, combining 2DG with chemotherapy may be a way to simultaneously target both hypoxic and aerobic cells in tumors. Four factors may play a role in the preferential toxicity of 2DG in malignant cells: (1) increased uptake and retention of glucose analogs by malignant cells; (2) relative hypoxia of tumor cells relative to normal cells; (3) malignant cells may be more sensitive to glucose deprivation than normal cells; and (4) inhibition of glycolysis may increase sensitivity to some cytotoxic agents. Preliminary data in human tumor xenografts support this hypothesis. Because 2DG is most likely to be effective in combination with chemotherapy, this trial was designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2DG both alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Docetaxel was chosen because there is evidence in human tumor xenografts of delayed tumor growth for 2DG in combination with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone and it has been reported that taxanes may enhance uptake of 2DG into malignant cells. Patients with advanced solid tumors were chosen because they are appropriate candidates for a Phase I clinical trial and because their tumors are likely to have areas of hypoxia.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"advanced solid tumors, cancer, docetaxel, 2 deoxy D glucose (2DG), phase 1",,Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Head and Neck Cancer, Gastric Cancer",2 deoxy D glucose (2DG)

NCT00462995,Surgery for Early Lung Cancer With Preoperative Erlotinib (Tarceva): A Clinical Phase II Trial (SELECT),"2.5 Rationale for preoperative erlotinib therapy Erlotinib is the only EFGR tyrosine kinase inhibitor to demonstrate a survival advantage and symptom improvement in a large phase III trial after failure of chemotherapy in advanced non small cell lung cancer (Shepherd, Rodrigues Pereira et al. 2005). Although the potential utility of erlotinib in earlier stage NSCLC is unclear, given its activity in advanced disease and its minimal toxicity profile, there is likely a subset of patients who may benefit and potentially be cured by adjuvant erlotinib therapy. Erlotinib may also have greater antitumour activity in earlier stage disease. Therefore, we propose a phase II study to assess erlotinib pre operatively in clinical stage 1 and 2 NSCLC, and downstream effects on signal transduction pathways and possible markers of treatment resistance and sensitivity. The proposed study involves administering oral erlotinib for four weeks (28 days) preoperatively in early stage (1A,B, 2A,B) NSCLC. Current waiting times for surgical resection of early stage NSCLC at UHN ranges from 4 to 6 weeks (Hui, Johnston et al. 2004), thus patients would not experience significant delay in time to surgery through this trial design. This study provides the opportunity to explore the impact of erlotinib on early stage NSCLC in humans, with pharmacodynamic assessment expected in 100% of patients post treatment, in addition to correlative imaging. This study will evaluate the feasibility of preoperative therapy with erlotinib, and may facilitate the identification of predictive markers for response to erlotinib in early stage NSCLC. This may help further define the subset of patients who would benefit from adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and those who may require other adjuvant approaches including chemotherapy and further clinical trials.","Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients may be identified by thoracic surgeons, respirologists and,or interventional chest radiologists for study participation upon clinical and radiographic assessment. 4.2 Diagnostic biopsy, Pretreatment Investigations If patients have already had a core or FNA biopsy before referral, this material will be sought from the original pathologist for review and inclusion in the study with appropriate consent sought. If a patient does not have a biopsy upon presentation to the thoracic surgeon, and consents to inclusion in the trial, a percutaneous biopsy will be mandated as part of entry into the study. The order of test will be up to the treating thoracic surgeon. As part of this procedure a large localizing needle is inserted into the tumour. In collaboration with pathology, a fine needle is passed through the outer needle and an immediate diagnosis will be made at the time of fine needle aspiration biopsy. After a pathologic diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, additional biopsies to obtain material for correlative studies will be performed through the standard localizing needle, assuming no complications or technical difficulties have arisen. These studies will be done in collaboration with thoracic interventional radiologists from Diagnostic Imaging, who perform the lung fine needle aspirates and biopsies. All patients will undergo pre study assessments for symptoms, performance status, radiographic assessment and blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and renal function tests). Blood samples before treatment and post treatment with erlotinib will be banked for future serum proteomic analysis. Assessment of response will occur after the 4 week treatment period. Toxicity will be assessed continuously, with patient assessment weekly on treatment, repeat blood tests at 2 weeks and imaging of measurable disease at 4 weeks. All subjects will be invited to have their initial diagnostic biopsy and subsequent surgical tumor specimen examined as part of the laboratory correlate component of the study. Patients will be considered evaluable for pharmacodynamic assessment if they complete at least 21 of the planned 28 days of therapy. Patients will have PET CT scan study done pre and post treatment (see section 7). If the enrolment PET CT imaging reveals mediastinal disease (IIIA or IIIB) or extensive disease and this is pathologically confirmed the patient will not be enrolled in the study. Once the diagnosis is established and assessment completed, oral erlotinib will be administered at a dose of 150 mg (1 pill) daily for 28 days prior to the planned mediastinoscopy and,or surgery. Tablets should be taken preferably in the morning with up to 200 mL of water at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. If the patient forgets to take a dose, they should take the last missed dose as soon as they remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. If patient vomits after taking the dose, the dose may be retaken if the tablet is seen in the emesis. The last dose of erlotinib will be administered early in the morning of the mediastinoscopy or surgery. If the mediastinoscopy reveals the presence of Stage III disease, the patients mediastinoscopy samples may still be analyzed as part of the correlative study. Patients will be followed for 90 days or as long as required after the last dose of erlotinib to ensure resolution of any erlotinib related toxicities. However these patients will be offered standard therapy for stage III disease off study protocol, for example a combination of chemotherapy, radiation with or without surgical resection. If these patients do proceed to thoracotomy post chemotherapy and,or radiotherapy, their resection specimen will not be eligible for this correlative protocol.",Completed,All,18 Years,95 Years,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Lung Cancer, Erlotinib, Neoadjuvant Treatment",Before surgery and after surgery,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Erlotinib, Erlotinib"

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are agents with favorable toxicity profiles that have shown activity in patients with NSCLC. Erlotinib as a single agent is currently approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC whose disease has progressed following one prior course of chemotherapy and is currently being evaluated in NSCLC patients who have not received prior systemic treatment. However, when studied with combination chemotherapy in the first line setting, continuous daily administration of erlotinib did not result in improved patient survival. Further clinical and in vitro data suggest that the sequencing of cytotoxic chemotherapy with EGFR TKIs is important to maximize their therapeutic potential when administered in combination. Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member of the platinum based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum based drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally and is currently being evaluated in a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial as 2nd line therapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. The rationale for this study is to develop an active and well tolerated oral regimen for patients ≥ 70 years of age with NSCLC. Administration of the study drugs will be sequenced with satraplatin administered on days 1 5 and erlotinib on days 8 21 of each 28 day cycle. The primary endpoint will be progression free survival (PFS). Patients will be randomized to treatment with either the experimental regimen or single agent continuous erlotinib.","Erlotinib as a single agent is currently approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC whose disease has progressed following one prior course of chemotherapy and is currently being evaluated in NSCLC patients who have not received prior systemic treatment.

Further clinical and in vitro data suggest that the sequencing of cytotoxic chemotherapy with EGFR TKIs is important to maximize their therapeutic potential when administered in combination. Satraplatin is an orally administered platinum analogue that has shown promising single agent activity in multiple tumor types including prostate, ovarian, and small cell lung cancer. Additionally, the single agent activity of satraplatin in NSCLC is similar to that of other commonly used platinum agents used to treat NSCLC. However, satraplatin is better tolerated than cisplatin, causing less renal toxicity and ototoxicity, and it can be administered in the outpatient setting. From a toxicity profile, it is more similar to carboplatin in that myelosuppression is its dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Satraplatin is currently being evaluated in a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial as 2nd line therapy for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. The rationale for this study is to develop an active and well tolerated oral regimen for patients ≥ 70 years of age with NSCLC who may not be candidates for aggressive combination systemic chemotherapy.

NCT00702182,Study of Oral Vinorelbine and Erlotinib in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,The purpose of this study is to define the schedule and dose of oral vinorelbine (Navelbine) to be used with erlotinib in non small cell lung cancer.,"Additive or supraadditive activity of an EGFR TK I with vinorelbine has been demonstrated in vitro. Clinical synergism has also been described between gefitinib and vinorelbine in NSCLC. The use of cytotoxics in a metronomic schedule has not been well investigated in the clinical setting despite emerging pre clinical data. Using an established oral cytotoxic such as oral vinorelbine in a metronomic dose schedule is attractive due to the oral route of administration. Preclinical studies have shown that by using cytotoxics in a low dose protracted manner, endothelial cells are preferentially affected via inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition to this anti angiogenic mechanism, an anti vasculogenic process may also be involved that acts by reducing circulating endothelial progenitor mobilization and viability. Moreover, it has also been shown that tumours that were selected for high levels of acquired resistance to cytotoxics can be induced to respond by using metronomic doses of chemotherapy. Continuous administration of metronomic oral vinorelbine, given three times a week, has been reported as feasible and well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg total dose per week. Early results showed activity against refractory solid tumors such as renal cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, unknown primary and Kaposi sarcoma.

NCT00826449,Dasatinib and Erlotinib in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),The goal of the Phase I portion of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride that can be given to patients with advanced solid tumors. The goal of the Phase II portion of this study is to learn if this combination is effective when given to patients with non small cell lung cancer. The safety of this combination will be studied in both phases.,"The Study Drugs: Dasatinib is designed to decrease the activity of one or more proteins that are responsible for the uncontrolled growth of tumor cells. This may cause the tumor cells to die. Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface of many tumor cells. Blocking the protein may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to participate in this study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you joined this study. Up to 6 groups of 3 6 participants each will be enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 35 participants will be enrolled in Phase II. If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of dasatinib you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of dasatinib. Each new group will receive a higher dose of dasatinib than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. If intolerable side effects are seen, the next group of participants may receive the same dose level or a lower dose level. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib is found. If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive highest tolerated dose level of dasatinib that was found in the Phase I portion. All participants will receive the same dose level of erlotinib hydrochloride. If the doctor thinks it is needed, the dose level may be lowered. Study Drug Administration: If you are in Phase I, on Day 3 of Cycle 1 (3 days before your first dose of study drugs), you will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth. On Days 1 19 of Cycle 1, you will be take dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth once a day. On Days 20 and 21 of Cycle 1, you will only take dasatinib by mouth once a day. Every day of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will take dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth once a day. If you are in Phase II, every day you will take dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth once a day. Each cycle is 21 days. Erlotinib hydrochloride and dasatinib should be taken together at the same time every day. The tablets must be swallowed whole and may not be broken. The tablets should be taken with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals or any other drugs, and should not be taken with grapefruit juice. The entire dose must be taken at 1 time. If you vomit within 30 minutes of swallowing the tablets, the dose may be replaced if the tablets can be seen and counted.

NCT00816868,A Phase II Study of TX Regimen as First line Treatment for Asian Elderly Patients With Advanced Adenocarcinoma of Lung,"Because of the effect in the treatment of NSCLC, the capecitabine and erlotinib may compose to a new regimen for NSCLC. Based on the preclinical observation and the confirmed clinical synergistic anti tumor activity of combined capecitabine and erlotinib in gemzar refractory advanced pancreatic cancer (APC), the investigators previously conducted a phase II study of erlotinib in combination with capecitabine against NSCLC.","1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in the world. Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer, comprises about 80% of all lung cancer cases, and five year survival across all stages is about 12%. More than 60% of all NSCLC patients have advanced or metastatic disease that is not suitable for curative resection at diagnosis. Platinum based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for these patients and results in a small but statistically significant improvement in survival compared with supportive care alone.But the regimen is also associated with moderate to severe hematological and non hematological toxic effects in a majority of patients. Approximately two thirds of patients diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are 65 years or older, and nearly 50% are 70 years or older. And greater than 90% of elderly patients experience a grade 3,4 toxicity when treated with a platinum based doublet..Moreover，a group of patients with the performance status ≥2 is intolerant intravenous chemotherapy. Availability of an effective,less toxic therapy might help extend potentially beneficial treatment to a greater proportion of elderly or patients whose performance status ≥2. 1.2 Rationale 1.2.1 Capecitabine for NSCLC Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5 Fu.It is absorbed through the intestine and converted to 5 deoxy S fluorocytidine (5 DFCR) by carboxylesterase and then to 5 deoxy S fluorouridine (5 DFUR) by cytidine deaminase, both steps taking place in the liver. Finally,it is converted to the only active metabolite, FU, by thymidine phosphorylase（TP）. This occurs in both tumor and normal tissues; however, the TP is found at higher concentrations in some tumor tissue compared with normal healthy tissue.The expression of this enzymes may influence the effect of the capecitabine. Han et al examined the TP expression in tumor tissue samples from NSCLC patients who enrolled in a previous phase II study of capecitabine,docetaxel chemotherapy and found that the patients with high tumour cell thymidine phosphorylase expression show a better response to capecitabine based chemotherapy . The thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important target enzyme for antifolate drugs, such as 5 FU、UFT and capecitabine,because it catalyzes an essential step in DNA synthesis. The predictive role of the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) in tumors treated with antifolate drugs has been extensively reported in NSCLC.In 2006, Nakano et al performed an immunohistochemical study on the clinical significance of TS expression using 151 resected non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients postoperatively treated with UFT.They found that the 5 year survival rate of patients with TS negative tumours was significantly higher than that with TS positive tumours (P=0.0133).Miyoshi et al reported that the oral administration of UFT after surgery might improve the survival of NSCLC patients when TS levels in tumor tissues are low,with the 5 year survival rates of patients positive and negative for TS were 50.0 and 89.5%(p<0.001).Some research still found that TS expression was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinoma compared with adenocarcinoma when both mRNA levels and protein levels. Recently，a Phase III Study Comparing Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine With Cisplatin Plus Pemetrexed in Chemotherapy Naïve Patients With Advanced Stage Non Small Cell Lung Cancer showed that Overall survival was statistically superior for cisplatin, pemetrexed versus cisplatin,gemcitabine in patients with adenocarcinoma.The result reminded us that patients with adenocarcinoma were most likely to benefit from antifolate drugs. In the preclinical study, we examined tumor specimens for TS and TP expression obtained from 171 Chinese NSCLC patients who were operated without any preoperative chemotherapy or radiation at our institute. We categorized Grades 0 and 1 as negative, Grades 2 and 3 as positive for both enzymes. As for TS staining, 14.6% (n = 25) were classified as Grade 0, 28.7% (n = 49) as Grade 1, 32.7% (n = 56) as Grade 2 and 24.0% (n = 41) as Grade 3. And for TP staining, 12.3% (n = 21) were classified as Grade 0, 17.0% (n = 29) as Grade 1, 13.5% (n = 23) as Grade 2 and 57.3% (n =98) as Grade 3. Although the anti tumor activity of capecitabine has not been well evaluated in NSCLC, the relatively high expression of TP (70.8%) and low expression TS (43.3%) in NSCLC provided a rationale for the use of capecitabine in patients with this tumor. 1.2.2 Erlotinib for NSCLC Erlotinib is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK). It has been approved as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed following first and second line chemotherapy.It is fairly well tolerated and the salient adverse effects are mild to moderate skin rash and diarrhea. And the further study showed that adenocarcinoma histology predicted the better survival. Recently a trial of erlotinib as first line therapy in elderly patients has been reported by investigators at the Dana Farber Cancer Center. In 76 patients over the age of 70, the vast majority with adenocarcinoma histology, the response rate was 12% and a median survival was 11 months. 1.2.3 The synergistic interaction of erlotinib and capecitabine in NSCLC. Giovannetti et al reported that erlotinib significantly reduced TS expression and activity, possibly via E2F 1 reduction, as detected by RT PCR and western blot, and the combination decreased TS in situ activity in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, Van SS. et al found TS inhibitor (5 FU) increases EGFR phosphorylation which potentially favors EGFR TKIs activity.Thus, erlotinib and capecitabine may have a strong synergism in NSCLC. Because of the effect in the treatment of NSCLC, the capecitabine and erlotinib may compose to a new regimen for NSCLC.

NCT01229150,Randomized Phase II Study of AZD6244 (Mitogen activated Protein Kinase Inhibitor) MEK Inhibitor With Erlotinib in KRAS Wild Type Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and a Randomized Phase II Study of AZD6244 With Erlotinib in Mutant KRAS Adva...,"Background: AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) is an investigational anticancer drug that is designed to block a critical component (MEK (methyl ethyl ketone)) of a pathway (MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase pathway) that causes some lung cancer cells to grow. The MAP kinase pathway could be overactive in a proportion of lung cancers, including some which also have another mutation in a protein known as KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog). Approximately 20% of lung cancers have KRAS mutations which can make some cancer treatments including erlotinib, a standard anticancer treatment drug less effective. Researchers are interested in determining whether AZD6244 is effective in treating advanced NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer), including KRAS mutated lung cancer that has not responded to standard therapy. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of AZD6244, either alone or in combination with erlotinib, in preventing tumor growth in individuals with NSCLC. Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with advanced NSCLC that has not responded to standard therapy. Design: Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and potentially, tumor biopsy tests to determine whether a participants NSCLC contains mutations in the KRAS protein.. Participants will be divided into two groups based on the status of the KRAS protein in their NSCLC tumor cells:. Individuals with normal KRAS protein: Half will receive AZD6244 and erlotinib, and half will receive only erlotinib.. Individuals with mutated KRAS protein: Half will receive AZD6244 and erlotinib, and half will receive only AZD6244.. Participants will take their assigned medications daily (on an empty stomach in the morning and,or evening, depending on the treatment) for 28 day cycles of treatment. Participants will also keep a medication diary to record any side effects.. Participants will have frequent blood tests during the first cycle of treatment, and will have imaging studies or other tests as required by the study researchers. Participants may also have an additional tumor biopsy after the end of the first treatment cycle.. Treatment will continue until the disease progresses, significant side effects develop, the participant chooses to leave the study, or the researchers end the study....","Background: Lung Cancer is the leading cause of death among both men and women. Of the approximately 172,000 patients that are diagnosed every year with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the US, 55% present with advanced stage disease. The current treatment for advanced NSCLC is first line chemotherapy with a platinum based doublet. Second line treatment for recurrent or progressive disease includes treatment with chemotherapy or treatment with an oral EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Several mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been discovered. Presence of KRAS mutations is one of them. AZD6244 (ARRY 142886) is an investigational drug that is orally available and targets the critical kinase (MEK) in the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction pathway which is activated in NSCLC and is downstream of EGFR. Objectives: Determine the progression free survival (PFS) using the combination of AZD6244 and erlotinib in patients with wild type KRAS advanced NSCLC. Determine the clinical response rate (PR (partial response) + CR (complete response)) either monotherapy AZD6244 or the combination AZD6244 plus erlotinib in patients with mutated KRAS advanced NSCLC. Evaluate disease control rate (PR+CR+SD (stable disease)) and overall survival in both patient groups.. Determine a safety profile for use of AZD6244 in combination with erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC.. Measure serological markers to evaluate if these markers are correlated with tumor response.. Measure changes in a tumors MIB 1 (Ki 67) rate and pERK levels in response to treatment with AZD6244. Eligibility: Patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC not amenable to potentially curative therapy and having progressed after being treated with at least one prior platinum containing chemotherapy regimen, or having refused cytotoxic chemotherapy.. Progressive disease should be documented prior to enrollment on the study.. Patient should not have more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.. Measurable disease by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria.. Adequate renal, cardiac, hepatic and hematopoietic functions. No major surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy within 28 days of enrollment. Design: Patients will be stratified on the basis on their KRAS mutational status. Wild Type KRAS patients will be randomized to receive either single agent erlotinib 150 mg,day or the combination of erlotinib 100 mg,day plus AZD6244 at 150 mg,day. KRAS mutant patients will be randomized to receive AZD6244 monotherapy at a dose of 75 mg twice per day, or the combination AZD6244 at 150 mg,day plus erlotinib 100 mg,day.. Treatment will continue until disease progression.. Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 4.0.. Tumor assessments by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be performed every 2 cycles (one cycle is 28 days).. Correlative studies including initial tumor mutational analysis and tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies will be done on existing tumor blocks, or re biopsied tissue prior to enrollment.. Patients will be evaluated for the potential to undergo repeat tumor biopsy after 1 cycle of therapy. Tumors will be assessed for MIB 1 (Ki 67) and pERK levels by IHC..

NCT00983307,A Study of Erlotinib Plus Radiotherapy (RT) for Patients With Advanced or Inoperable Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"It is generally accepted that the presence of chronically hypoxic cells, or tumor cells which do not receive enough oxygen as a result of tumor growth, may be an important cause of resistance to radiation therapy (RT) and resultant tumor recurrence, particularly in large tumors such as advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, delivering a higher RT dose, as is done with hypofractionated RT, to the tumor may result in higher success rate. Erlotinib (Tarceva, previously known as OSI 774) is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. A recently completed trial has shown that Erlotinib as a single agent significantly improves the survival of patients with incurable Stage IIIb,IV NSCLC who have failed standard therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Therefore, Erlotinib is an approved medication for second line therapy in lung cancer following prior chemotherapy. This is a Phase II clinical research study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated radiation therapy in combination with Erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or inoperable non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators hypothesis is that the addition of erlotinib to RT will result in radiosensitization, therefore increasing the likelihood of local tumor control over RT alone. Maintenance erlotinib upon RT completion will result in further tumor growth inhibition, both systemically and locally, lengthening disease free survival and overall survival.","Hypothesis,Rationale: Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women in the United States, with over 170,000 cases diagnosed annually. The overall 5 year survival rate remains 14% despite decades of clinical research. Thoracic RT is the standard treatment for locally advanced (Stage III) NSCLC, in combination with chemotherapy in favorable patients. Metastatic lung cancer (Stage IV) is treated with systemic chemotherapy, with the addition of RT for palliation of tumor symptoms. Most lung cancers present as large tumors, measuring 2 to 7 cm in largest dimension. It is therefore not difficult to understand that only 16% of patients experience a complete resolution of their irradiated tumors within 3 months following a course of standard fractionated (2.0 Gy daily) RT and chemotherapy. From basic principles advocated by Fletcher, it is thought that standard fractionated RT doses up to 100.0 Gy may be necessary to sterilize tumors of the size frequently encountered in clinical practice. Tumor control probability for bronchogenic carcinoma can be estimated to be 10% for tumors of greater than 4 cm at a dose of 80.0 Gy, with an assumption, that an average size lung cancer may require doses beyond 100.0 Gy standard fractionated to have a 50% to 80% probability of controlling the tumor. This has been demonstrated in the stereotactic radioablation approach to patients with the medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC, in whom 20 Gy per fraction to a total of 60 Gy (a BED equivalent of >100 Gy) resulted in an excellent local control of >90% (Timmerman R et al, 2006; Onishi H et al, 2007). Hypofractionated RT: It is generally accepted that the presence of chronically hypoxic cells within tumors may be an important cause of radioresistance and resultant local failure in radiotherapy, particularly in large solid tumors such as locoregionally advanced NSCLC. In vitro experiments indicated that the dose needed to kill severely hypoxic cells is on the order of 2 or 3 times the dose needed for oxic cells. Therefore, delivering a higher RT dose to the tumor may result in higher tumor cell kill and improved local control. One of the approaches to increase RT dose is to use hypofractionated RT, which not only increases the dose, but also reduces the overall treatment time. The radiobiological rationale for hypofractionated RT was described by Mehta et al (Mehta et al, 2001). Based on these theoretical assumptions, University of Wisconsin has recently completed a dose escalation study of progressively increasing fraction sizes in thoracic RT for lung cancer. Such larger RT fraction sizes may require tighter radiation fields (to achieve reliable normal tissue sparing) and improved precision of RT delivery, something that is afforded by the SBF (Stereotactic Body Frame) immobilization and daily CT scan based image verification of tumor position. More experiences have been reported in the literature on hypofractionated regimens for lung cancer. Japanese investigators (Nagata Y et al, 2002) treated 40 patients with T1 T3N0 tumors or lung metastases with 10 12 Gy per fraction to a total of 40 48 Gy. No pulmonary (or other) complications >Grade 2 were observed and the local control was 100% in the subgroup of primary lung tumors. Another group from Japan (Onimaru R et al, 2003) reported on 45 patients with primary lung tumors up to 6cm receiving 7.5 Gy per fraction to 60 Gy (lesions <3cm) or 6 Gy per fractions to 48 Gy (lesions 3 6cm). One patient with a central tumor died of a radiation induced ulcer in the esophagus. One patient with a peripheral lesion experienced Grade 2 chest wall pain. The 3 year local control rate was 80%. No adverse respiratory events were noted. The ultimate hypofractionated RT regimen of 60 Gy given in 3 fractions of 20 Gy each has been demonstrated to be feasible and highly effective in patients with medically inoperable Stage I NSCLC tumors measuring up to 7 cm and located outside the central airways (Timmerman et al, 2006). However, the same regimen was associated with a high incidence of severe toxicity if applied to central airway. Since most tumors in patients with Stage III and IV NSCLC are located centrally, a novel hypofractionated regimen needs to be developed specifically for them. In our institution we have completed a Phase I,II investigator initiated trial of dose escalated hypofractionated RT given concurrently with Gefitinib (Iressa) with Gefitinib continued after RT completion until progression or toxicity. Three RT dose levels are applied: 4.2 Gy in 10 fractions to 42 Gy; 4.2 Gy in 12 fractions 50.4 Gy and 4.2 Gy in 15 fractions to 63 Gy. Eligible pts are those with either Stage III or IV NSCLC who needed thoracic RT and could not receive chemotherapy. No selection by the EGFR receptor status has been applied. A total of 12 patients have been enrolled. Main toxicities were pulmonary (1 grade 2 pneumonitis; 1 grade 3 infectious pneumonia; 1 grade 4 pneumonitis). There was 1 grade 3 abdominal pain. One patient (with thoracic tumor controlled) died due to the late radiation esophageal toxicity (tracheo esophageal fistula in a setting of pre existing esophageal diverticula) at 12 months from RT. Only one patient experienced local progression of the irradiated tumor, which is very encouraging and may support the hypothesis of the radiosensitizing effect of the EGFR inhibitors. As of now, median survival time for all 12 enrolled patients is 9 months (range: 1 26 mo) from the time of initiating Gefitinib, which is an encouraging result in mostly pretreated patients, many with metastatic disease (Werner Wasik et al, oral presentation, First ESMO,IASLC European Meeting on Lung Cancer, Geneva, Switzerland, April 2008). Since Gefitinib is not available now for wider use, we are proposing a study of erlotinib with hypofractionated RT in a Phase II setting with the main objective of assessing efficacy of such a combination. There is no direct evidence that patients receiving concurrent EGFR inhibitors and RT need to be pre selected with regard to the EGFR status. In a recent study (Bentzen SM et al, 2005), positive immunohistochemical staining for EGFR status was associated with a benefit in locoregional control in patients with head and neck cancer receiving CHART (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy), but the EGFR status had no effect on survival or rate of distant metastases. Therefore, we propose to investigate the EGFR status in all eligible patients, but to treat them without selection for the EGFR status. Tarceva (previously known as OSI 774) is an orally active, potent, selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Early clinical data with Tarceva indicate that the compound is generally safe and well tolerated at doses that provide the targeted effective concentration based on nonclinical experiments. A recently completed, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial (BR.21) has shown that Tarceva as a single agent significantly improves the survival of patients with incurable Stage IIIb,IV NSCLC who have failed standard therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (Shepherd F et al, 2000 and 2005). In a Phase II clinical trial (Jackman D et al, 2007) of 80 chemotherapy naive patients >70 years of age with advanced non small cell lung cancer who received erlotinib as first line therapy, an encouraging median survival time (MST) of 10.9 months was reported, with the presence of EGFR mutations strongly correlated with disease control and survival. In summary, a combination of erlotinib with hypofractionated thoracic RT has the potential to significantly improve local tumor control in patients with non small cell lung cancer, based on theoretical considerations of EGFR inhibition, increased tumor cell killing with larger RT fractions and preclinical evidence for synergism between RT and erlotinib. Our hypothesis is that the addition of erlotinib to RT will result in radiosensitization, therefore increasing the likelihood of local tumor control over RT alone. Maintenance erlotinib upon RT completion will result in further tumor growth inhibition, both systemically and locally, lengthening disease free survival and overall survival. All eligible patients will be enrolled, without regard for the EGFR status. The implications of prospectively screening patients for EGFR mutations or gene copy number and how the patients should be selected for subsequent treatment remain to be defined (Janne P et al, 2005; Shepherd f et al, 2005). Therefore, patients will not be excluded from trial participation based on the EGFR testing. The EGFR status will be assessed by the FISH assay in biopsy or resection tissue samples and the test will be performed by a commercial laboratory.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Radiation, Erlotinib, Tarceva",2 years,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non small cell Lung","Erlotinib, Hypofractionated Radiotherapy"

Tablets should be taken preferably in the morning 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with no more than 7 ounces of water. If you are unable to swallow tablets, you may dissolve the tablets in distilled water. If you forget to take a dose, the last missed dose should be taken as soon as you remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due to be taken. The next day, you should take the scheduled dose at the usual time. Every attempt should be made to keep from vomiting the medication for at least 30 minutes after taking it. For example, if you feel nauseated before or after taking the erlotinib, anti nausea medications should be used. The dose of erlotinib hydrochloride may be repeated if vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the tablet. Four (4) weeks is considered 1 treatment cycle. Every 4 weeks, your complete medical history will be recorded and you will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, breathing rate) and weight. You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for routine tests. You will have a performance status evaluation (questions about your ability to perform everyday activities). Your study doctor will ask you about any medications you are taking and your smoking history. Every 2 cycles, the tumor will be evaluated by chest x ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the status of the disease. If you are taking warfarin, you will have blood drawn (about 1 2 teaspoons) to check your blood clotting function weekly for the first 5 weeks of treatment and then every cycle after that. You may continue receiving erlotinib hydrochloride for as long as the cancer responds to study treatment. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you experience intolerable side effects, your medical condition gets worse, or you are unable to comply with study requirements. If you stop study treatment, you may be able to enroll in 1 of the remaining 3 protocols of the BATTLE program. You should discuss this with your doctor.

The current study uses a drug called OSI 774 in previously treated African American patients with NSCLC. OSI 774 is a targeted agent designed as an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

OSI 774 is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with non small cell lung cancer that had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, very little data exist in the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of EGFR blockers in African Americans and in the assessment of how efficacious these agents are in this patient group. Yet, research suggests that EGFR blockage may have a greater impact on this patient population. Since the development of skin rash following therapy with EGFR blockers may be a surrogate of obtaining sufficient concentrations at the tissue level and potential efficacy, the current study is a randomized phase II trial designed to compare normal dose levels of OSI 774 with dose levels determined by body weight and with subsequent amounts adjusted further into the study to generate a skin rash. Through the current study, researchers are testing their theory that this dosing method will increase the number of patients with effective tissue concentrations and result in an increase in patient responses. Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to determine the objective tumor response rate, the time to tumor progression, and the survival rate at one year produced by OSI 774 in previously treated African American patients with advanced NSCLC. A second objective is to evaluate if a regimen of single agent OSI 774, with dosing initially influenced by body weight and with subsequent titration to achieve skin rash is a suitable regimen for future studies of this agent. A third objective is to measure if changes in EGFR from tumor and blood cells correlate with the development of rash and clinical benefit. The pharmacokinetics of OSI 774 will also be characterized through study participants. Treatment: Patients in this study will be given OSI 774. A computer will randomly assign patients into one of two treatment groups. Group one will be given a standard dose of OSI 774. The dose of OSI 774 will not be increased in group one. However, patients in group one will have the dose level decreased due to unacceptable side effects. Group two will receive OSI 774 at a dose modified to their body weight at study entry and subsequently adjusted further into the study to generate a skin rash. For all study participants, OSI 774 will be administered daily in oral pills. Several tests and exams will be given throughout the study to closely monitor patients. Treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth or unacceptable side effects.",Completed,All,18 Years,,African Americans,"12 weeks, Every 12 weeks, 12 months",Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung",erlotinib
NCT01130753,"Efficacy of Erlotinib in Neoadjuvant Setting in Patients With Stage IIIA, N2 positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer",This study propose neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic role by erlotinib.,"It is widely accepted that patients with locally advanced non small cell lung cancer would have better outcome with neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery than surgery alone. However what should be the standard treatment option is still unclear. Erlotinib (Tarceva®)is an oral inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase and its anti neoplastic effect is approved especially women, patients with adenocarcinoma, non smoker and Asian population. Moreover if the malignant tissue has EGFR mutation, its efficacy is known to be enhanced.

NCT00717847,A Study of Serum Protein Profiling in Patients With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Gefitinib or Erlotinib,We hypothesize that Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors modulate tumor changes that may be reflected in the alteration of serum proteins. Study objectives are: To establish serum proteomic changes in patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving erlotinib or gefitinib.. To identify a serum protein profile that predicts erlotinib or gefitinib sensitivity or resistance in NSCLC patients with and without EGFR mutations.. To study the toxicity of erlotinib or gefitinib by correlating clinical toxicity with serum protein profile.,"Background: Although some success has been achieved in identifying Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as a molecular predictive marker of response in patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this strategy is likely only to be limited as not all responding patients have a mutation in their tumor and conversely, not all patients with a mutation were responders. Furthermore, as the development of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as gefitinib, erlotinib is inevitable and poses a major clinical problem due to limited therapeutic options, the identification of a molecular profile that could predict sensitivity to erlotinib or gefitinib is warranted. Hypothesis: Using serum as an easily accessible biological fluid, we hypothesize that EGFR TKIs modulate tumor changes that may be reflected in the alteration of serum proteins. Objectives: To establish the serum proteomic changes in NSCLC patients receiving erlotinib or gefitinib.. To identify a serum protein profile that predicts erlotinib or gefitinib sensitivity or resistance in NSCLC patients with and without EGFR mutations.. To study the toxicity of erlotinib or gefitinib by correlating clinical toxicity with serum protein profile. Significance: An extensive profiling of the molecular circuitry affected by EGFR TKIs would be helpful in understanding the response and side effects of patients with NSCLC treated with erlotinib or gefitinib and could guide therapy and thus improve patient outcome.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,,,,,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,

NCT00385996,"Pilot Study of Preoperative Tarceva (Erlotinib) for Stages I,II Non Small Cell Lung Cancer",The main purpose of this study is to see if Tarceva® (erlotinib) is effective in shrinking tumors. A high resolution CT scan (CT scanner that can view 3 dimensional images of the tumor) will be used to measure the tumor before and after treatment with Tarceva®(erlotinib) . This type of CT scan will measure the tumor by volume and by standard measurement (length and width). Both methods will be compared to find out whether standard measurement or measurement by tumor volume is more accurate.,"Tarceva® (erlotinib) is a drug that blocks a receptor called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) on certain cells including tumor cells.

NCT00779389,"Comparison of Biomarker Modulation by Inhibition of EGFR and,or SRC Family",The central hypothesis to be tested in this study is that dual blockade of EGFR and Src pathways or proteins are distinct compared to inhibition of either kinase alone in head and neck and lung cancers.,"Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) constitutes 3% of all malignancies and is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. There will be an estimated 40,000 new cases and 11,000 deaths in the United States in 2007 and approximately 500,000 cases worldwide yearly 1. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for at least 90% of all head and neck cancers. Surgical resection remains a standard treatment for patients with resectable HNSCC. For patients with high risk of local or distant relapse, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, is given after surgery to improve loco regional control and overall survival. Moreover, surgery often represents the only curative option in patients who relapse locoregionally. Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of death worldwide. NSCLC is infrequently diagnosed when the cancer can be eradicated with surgical extirpation. Specific Aims To determine the modulation of biomarkers by EGFR and,or Src targeting in head and neck and lung cancers.. To determine if biomarker modulation is associated with reduction of tumor volume and,or evidence of histologic response in the tumor (e.g. decreased proliferation and,or decreased apoptosis) as well as safety and tolerability. Subject population Patients will be accrued from head and neck and lung cancer patients who are surgical candidates. Surgery will be the primary curative treatment for patients enrolled in this study. Patients should not require any standard induction treatment prior to surgery. Surgery will have to be the best treatment option as determined by the treating physician. Therefore, we will not be delaying chemoradiotherapy or other curative treatment. We plan to include any stage of HNSCC or NSCLC that will be managed by primary surgery. If surgery is unexpectedly cancelled, the patient will be removed from the study unless there is an accessible lesion for biopsy. Ideally, the pre treatment biopsy and the intraoperative sample will be obtained from the same site (when there are multiple lesions). Please see Section 3.0 for detailed eligibility criteria. Treatment Plan The study drug or placebo will be taken for 14 21 days, and will be discontinued one day prior to planned surgical resection. If surgery is delayed, the study drug or placebo will be continued until one day prior to surgery, for up to a maximum of 28 days. Seven days is the minimum treatment for the patients to be evaluated. The interval between the last dose of experimental drug and surgery will be 12 36 hours. Please see Section 5.0 for treatment plan details. If the combination of erlotinib and dasatinib results in toxicity leading to a delay in surgery, the study will be terminated. Statistical design and sample size This is a 4 arm randomized trial that is intended to estimate the effects of short term preoperative therapy with EGFR and Src inhibitors upon a panel of biomarkers. The 4 treatment arms are erlotinib, dasatinib, their combination, and a placebo.

NCT01556191,Lung Cancer in Women Treated With Anti oestrogens anD Inhibitors of EGFR,"Lung Cancer is to become the first cause of death related to cancer in France as its already the case in United States. At Present, Lung Cancer in women and in men is treated similarly. Nevertheless, numerous studies shows that lung cancer in women has specificities : at the time of the diagnosis female patients are younger, there are less clinical signs, clinical stages are earlier, histology is often adenocarcinoma. The link with tabagism is weaker . Sensitivity to tabagism is higher (more cancer in women with the same tabagism). Response rate to chemotherapy is better. Prognosis is better Numerous hypotheses have been put forward to account for the specific characteristics of female lung cancer described above. One hypothesis is that there are different genetic anomalies in women. Some studies show an increase of EGFR mutation and HER2 expression and a decrease of expression of repair enzymes (ERCC1, RRM1, BRCA) which can explain the increase sensitivity to tabagism and to chemotherapy.. Another hypothesis is that hormones play a role in oncogenesis. Indeed, lung cancer presents hormonal risk factors : pre menopause, less than 3 kids, short menstrual cycle, hormone replacement therapy. Estrogens would have a deleterious effect on cancer incidence and on survival of lung cancer in women. Cellular and animal models show that ER pathway is activated in lung cancer and participates in oncogenesis.. Moreover an interaction between RE and EGFR pathway has been demonstrated on lung cancer cell lines and mouse models. EGFR TKI have shown benefit in women with wild type EGFR or unknown status (with erlotinib) and in women with EGFR mutations (with gefitinib). In this study, the use of these two treatment will be in accordance with their market authorisations. The objective of this study is to test the addition of an anti estrogen (fulvestrant) to EGFR TKI. Fulvestrant is a pure anti oestrogen that binds to ER, blocks it and accelerates its breakdown. It has a market authorisation in breast cancer. Furthermore the association between EGFR TKI and anti estrogen could have a synergetic effect due to interaction between RE and EGFR pathways .",,Completed,Female,18 Years,,"lung cancer, women","Around nine months, Around three months",Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Stage IV Lung Cancer,"Gefitinib, Fulvestrant, Erlotinib"
NCT01248247,BATTLE 2 Program: A Biomarker Integrated Targeted Therapy Study in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Different people have different biomarkers (chemical markers in the blood that may be related to your reaction to study drugs). If researchers know about your biomarkers before you receive treatment, they may be able to prescribe a treatment that is better suited to your body\s specific needs. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if drug or drug combinations based on your biomarkers can help to control NSCLC. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.","The Study Drugs: Erlotinib hydrochloride, MK 2206, AZD6244, and Sorafenib are targeted therapies. Targeted therapy is a type of drug that blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific targeted molecules needed for tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with rapidly dividing cells (for example with traditional chemotherapy). Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4 groups: If you are in Group 1, you will take erlotinib alone.. If you are in Group 2, you will take erlotinib and MK 2206.. If you are in Group 3, you will take AZD6244 and MK 2206.. If you are in Group 4, you will take sorafenib alone. The group you are in will be assigned by a computer. The results of your screening tests will be used to determine (and may limit) which of the 4 groups you may be eligible to be assigned to. Your likelihood of being in any 1 group over another may also be affected by how well that treatment has done in earlier study participants. Your study doctor will tell you which group you have been assigned. Study Drug Administration: Each cycle is 28 days. If you are in Group 1, you will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth 1 time every day.. If you are in Group 2, you will take MK 2206 by mouth 1 time every week. You will take erlotinib hydrochloride by mouth 1 time every day.. If you are in Group 3, you will take MK 2206 by mouth 1 time per week. You will take AZD6244 by mouth 1 time every day.. If you are in Group 4, you will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times every day. If you will take erlotinib hydrochloride (Groups 1 and 2), you should take the tablets in the morning. You should take the drug 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, with no more than 7 ounces of water. If you forget to take a dose, the last missed dose should be taken as soon as you remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose. The next day, you should take the scheduled dose at the usual time. You should try not to vomit for at least 30 minutes after taking the drug. If you feel nauseated before or after taking the erlotinib, you should take an anti nausea drug. You may take an extra dose of erlotinib if you vomit within 30 minutes after taking the tablet. If you are in Group 2, you should take MK 2206 at about the same time each week with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You must take MK 2206 at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after any food or a meal. You should not make up any missed doses. If you are in Group 3, you should take MK 2206 at about the same time each week with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You must take MK 2206 at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after eating. You should not make up any missed doses. If you will take AZD6244 (Group 3), you should take the study drug in the morning before you eat or drink anything. You can eat breakfast 1 hour after you take the dose. If you will take sorafenib, you must take your doses 12 hours apart. You will take 2 tablets each morning, and again each evening. Sorafenib should be taken with about 1 cup of water on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal).

NCT00966472,Phase I Study of a Statin + Erlotinib for Advanced Solid Malignancies With Focus on Squamous Cell Carcinomas and NSCLC,The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of rosuvastatin that can be given in combination with standard erlotinib treatment in patients with advanced incurable squamous cell cancer and NSCLC.,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of anti cancer medical treatment for the vast majority of patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell cancers. However, curative success remains low and most patients eventually succumb to the disease or its complications. Moreover, cytotoxic chemotherapy is frequently associated with severe unwanted side effects. Therefore, in this patient population the unmet therapeutic need is high and new treatment is required. Statins are drugs which inhibit the cellular mevalonate pathway and are conventionally used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in cardiovascular disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that statins might be used for cancer prevention,treatment through their interactions with essential cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent in vitro data indicate that statins induce growth arrest and apoptosis, inhibit secretion of proteolytic enzymes, reduce invasiveness and inhibit angiogenesis. These effects contribute to the reduction of tumor growth and metastases in preclinical in vivo models of a variety of tumors suggesting that statins may be useful in anticancer therapy. Studies previously performed by our group demonstrated that targeting the mevalonate pathway can induce tumor specific cytotoxicity in a number of tumor types that included squamous cell carcinomas, myeloid leukemia and a variety of pediatric cancers. Additionally, several clinical trials have also assessed the antitumor activity of statins. Pre clinically, we have demonstrated additive cytotoxic effects when combining lovastatin with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in HNSCC cells (AG1478) and in 8 squamous cell carcinomas (gefitinib). Mechanistically, lovastatin treatment inhibited EGF induced EGFR autophosphorylation by 24hrs and showed co operative targeting of the EGFR in combination with gefitinib. Taken together, these results demonstrate that targeting the mevalonate pathway can inhibit EGFR function and suggest the potential utility of combining these classes of drugs (i.e. an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a statin). The use of lovastatin is not optimal due to greatly enhanced toxicity with drugs such as gefitinib and erlotinib that are simultaneously metabolized by the same enzyme (cytP450A4). In contrast, rosuvastatin a relatively novel potent mevalonate pathway inhibitor is not metabolized significantly by cytP450A4. Due to the enhanced clinical activity of erlotinib in comparison to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the combination of erlotinib and rosuvastatin appears ideal.",Completed,All,18 Years,70 Years,"Rosuvastatin, Erlotinib, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Nom Small Cell Lung Cancer",Within 6 months,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer",Erlotinib + Rosuvastatin

NCT01402089,Cytochrom p450 3A4 and 1A2 Phenotyping for the Individualization of Treatment With Sunitinib or Erlotinib in Cancer Patients,"It is well known that substantial interindividual variability of CYP3A4,1A2 phenotype activity is an important contributor to individual differences in the sensitivity to the frequently used tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and erlotinib. This study tests the potential for CYP phenotyping to predict individual pharmacology and derive dosing algorithms for more tailored treatment of these drugs.","Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to show that the individual CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 phenotype as assessed by probe drugs predicts drug exposure to sunitinib and erlotinib. Secondary objectives of the study are to define the correlation between the individual CYP phenotype and treatment related toxicity, testing the feasibility of drug bioanalysis from patients dry blood spots (DBS), build an integrated covariate model on sunitinib and erlotinib pharmacokinetics and define a dosing algorithm for both sunitinib and erlotinib based on the individual CYP phenotype. Study endpoints: Primary endpoint: • To show that individual drug clearance of sunitinib or erlotinib is significantly higher in patients with a high activity CYP3A4,1A2 phenotype. Secondary endpoints: To specify the correlation between the CYP phenotype and treatment related toxicity.. To assess the feasibility of drug bioanalysis from patients dry blood spots (DBS).. To build an integrated covariate model of sunitinib and erlotinib pharmacokinetics to define the quantitative relationship between the CYP phenotype activity and drug exposure.. To define a dosing algorithm for both sunitinib and erlotinib based on the individual CYP phenotype using data simulations on the previously defined population covariate model. Trial Design: Prospective, nonrandomized, pharmacological cohort study. Main selection criteria Histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell cancer (sunitinib), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (sunitinib) or non small cell lung cancer (erlotinib). Both early or advanced tumor stage. Indication for the therapeutic use of either sunitinib or erlotinib. Written informed consent and willing to undergo PK sampling. Adequate organ function. No concurrent radiotherapy or systemic anticancer treatment with another drug Trial Duration The present study is projected to start in June 2011, with the inclusion of a total of 60 patients (at least 25 patients for each sunitinib and erlotinib). The study is expected to finalize patient accrual in December 2013. Statistical considerations The trial is designed to show a linear inverse relationship between the individual CYP phenotype and total drug steady state AUC (sunitinib plus SU12662 and erlotinib plus OSI 420, respectively), whereat CYP1A2 only accounts for the metabolism of erlotinib. With the inclusion of 60 patients, the study has a power of 90% to detect a relevant relationship between the CYP phenotype activity and sunitinib,erlotinib steady state AUC, with a regression coefficient of >0.4 for the H1 hypothesis (and accepting a regression coefficient of >0.1 for the H0 hypothesis) at the 5% significance level.

NCT01593995,EGF Ointment for Erlotinib Skin Lesion,"Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosin kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI, Erlotinib) has demonstrated its efficacy in patients with non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. But, their use is associated with dermatologic reactions of varying severity. Incidence of Erlotinib related skin effect (ERSE) was reported ~75% in NSCLC and pancreatic cancer phase III trials. Even though the dermatologic reactions could be a surrogated marker, it may be cause of dose modification. Also, it could give significant physical and psycho social discomfort to patients. However, there is still a wide variety of drugs used including, steroid, antibiotics, and vitamin D without any clear evidence based management recommendation. The role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been extensively investigated in normal and pathological wound healing. It is implicated in keratinocyte migration, fibroblast function and the formation of granulation tissue. The first growth factor to be isolated growth factor therapy has progressed into clinical practice in the treatment of wounds. Therefore, the investigators propose an epidermal growth factor ointment apply for patients with Erlotinib related skin effects.","Erlotinib Advances in the knowledge of tumor biology and mechanisms of oncogenesis has granted the singling out of several molecular targets for NSCLC treatment. Among these targets, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or HER1, has received particular attention in lung cancer treatment. EGFR is a transmembrane receptor found primarily on cells of epithelial origin. Autophosphorylation of its intracellular domain initiates a cascade of events leading to cell proliferation. EGFR is commonly expressed at a high level in a variety of solid tumors and it has been implicated in the control of cell survival, proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. The main pharmacological strategies in clinical development for therapeutic inhibition of EGFR are monoclonal antibodies to antagonize ligand receptor binding, and small molecules to inhibit tyrosine kinase domain activation. The main EGFR inhibitors are cetuximab, an anti EGFR monoclonal antibody, and Erlotinib an EGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor. The key indications for clinical use are colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer for cetuximab and NSCLC for Erlotinib. Erlotinib, a quinazolin 4 amine, is a highly potent, orally available, reversible inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase. Erlotinib, in a phase III randomized placebo controlled trial, has been proven to prolong survival (6.7 months versus 4.7 months for Erlotinib and for placebo respectively, p = 0.001) in NSCLC patients after first or second line chemotherapy. The analysis of quality of life and time to deterioration of patients reported symptoms showed statistically and clinically meaningful benefit for patients randomized to Erlotinib. Moreover, Erlotinib resulted active (response rate of 8.9%) and safe (only 5% of patients discontinued treatment for toxicity). Following this trial, Erlotinib has been approved by Food and Drug Administration and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use in chemotherapy pretreated advanced NSCLC. Skin rash is a common side effect of all HER1,EGFR inhibitors. EGF ointment Rash affecting the skin above the waist, is the most common adverse event associated with Erlotinib, and generally develops within 7 10 days of starting treatment. Skin rash may spontaneously resolve and reappear and it is reversible following drug discontinuation. However, when it develops, this chronic side effect is very distressing for the patient. The increasing use of EGFR targeted agents and specifically of Erlotinib in NSCLC treatment, and simultaneously the lack of clinical trials on this topic, makes rash management and etiology investigation high priorities. It has been reported that repeated treatment with EGF increases the epithelial cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner and accelerates the wound healing process, whereas a single EGF treatment has no noticeable effect on the wound healing rate. There have been many studies aimed at developing a topical formulation with the sustained and stable pharmacological properties of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF). And the rh EGF concentration between 1 and 5 ug,g can be seen as the ideal concentration to achieve the most efficient results for acute wounds with partial thickness defects.",Completed,All,20 Years,,"Erlotinib, Skin side effect, EGF ointment",4 weeks,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Non small Cell Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer",Epidermal growth factor (EGF) ointment

NCT01023828,K RAS Oncogene Mutation in Patients With Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Associated With Exposure to Wood Smoke and Tobacco Smoking: Therapeutic Implications,"Summary: Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related death in the world. This neoplasia has a poor survival prognosis due to the low effectiveness of existing treatments. The low effectiveness is associated with the development of an intrinsic and acquired resistance of tumors, which clinically shows through early progression and transitory responses. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for NSCLC; however, wood smoke has been described as a strong carcinogen and a relevant risk factor for the development of NSCLC. Current data indicates that lung tumors associated with tobacco smoking and wood smoke show different clinical characteristics, which suggests that they might also have different genetic alterations, which are a consequence of tumor etiology. The description of the frequency and the type of mutations associated with different etiologies of NSCLC could represent the starting point for benefiting each patient according to their specific characteristics. One of the most researched signaling pathways related to cancer cell proliferation is the one activated by the K RAS oncogene. Active K RAS mutations have been detected in different types of neoplasia and more than 90% of these mutations occur at codon 12 of the oncogene. These mutations seem to be an independent risk factor for the prognosis of malignant tumors and they are associated with the lack of response to erlotinib, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The investigators research team has recently reported that wood smoke is an independent factor for survival and response to the erlotinib treatment, which suggests that this carcinogen could have a different frequency and pattern of mutations in the K RAS oncogene, compared to what has been reported in smoking patients. Determining the tumor mutations within the K RAS oncogene can help improve the response prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC who have a background of exposure to different factors associated with the appearance of this neoplasia, such as wood smoke exposure or tobacco smoking. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the frequency and the type of mutations at codon 12 of the K RAS oncogene in patients with NSCLC who have a background of exposure to tobacco smoking or wood smoke.","Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death among men and women worldwide (1). In 2007, 213,380 new cases of lung cancer were registered; from these cases, 160,390 deaths were reported. This number represents 15% of the total cases and 29% of cancer related deaths in the world. Only 13% of the patients with lung cancer survive for 5 years surveillance epidemiology and end result (seer) statistics http:,,seer. cancer.gov,, therefore it still is a serious health problem (2). Clinically speaking, lung cancer is divided into two main categories that cover small cell lung cancer and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). About 75% of all lung tumors are NSCLC, including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (1). Despite the multimodal treatment using chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery there is a poor prognosis for locally advanced NSCLC. Survival rates for clinical stage IIIA is 64% at one year and between 23% and 30% after five years; for clinical stage IIIB 32% and 3% after one and five years, respectively (3). While advancements in the treatment of NSCLC have been made, few survival rate improvements have been achieved. Tobacco smoking is considered the main cause of NSCLC, but there are other risk factors as well, such as the exposure to asbestos, radon, heavy metals, and wood smoke. The latter has been described as a human carcinogen and an important risk factor for the development of NSCLC. The frequency of exposure to wood smoke in patients with NSCLC is 28% (2). Current data indicates than lung cancer associated with tobacco smoking and the lung cancer associated with wood smoke exposure present different clinical characteristics, which suggests that they might also have different genetic alterations, which are a consequence of tumor etiology. Nevertheless, there are no significant molecular researches that make possible to determine the differences in the pattern of mutations in oncogenes involved in lung tumorigenesis, in relation to the risk factors accounted by the patient. Recent advances in the knowledge of cancer biology have led to the identification of various potential molecular targets that play a major role in the development and progression of the disease. One of the most extensively researched signaling pathways involved in the cell proliferation and survival is the one activated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). When the epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR the kinase property of the receptor is activated regulating the activation of different signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to the activation of K RAS, which at the same time activates the pathway of MAP kinase, involved in the proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival of the cell (these are fundamental events in oncogenesis). Reports indicate that mutations in EGFR can be found in 51% of non smoking patients (4) and in 10% of smoking patients, while mutations in K RAS occur in 30% to 50% of the lung adenocarcinomas associated with tobacco. Active mutations in K RAS not only occur in NSCLC, but they also occur in >50% of the colorectal adenocarcinomas, 75% of pancreatic tumors, 48% of lung cancer, and 44% of adrenocortical tumors (5). These mutations seem to be an independent risk factor for the prognosis of malignant tumors, since more than 90% of them occur at the codon 12 of the K RAS gene (6 8), and they are associated with lack of response to erlotinib (9), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our research team has recently reported that wood smoke is an independent factor for the survival and response to a treatment with erlotinib (10). This information strongly supports the hypothesis that lung cancer tumorigenesis results from different molecular mechanisms according to the smokers stage (11) or other carcinogenic factors associated with the appearance of the malignant neoplasia, such as wood smoke exposure. Therefore, we believe that, compared to what has been reported in smoking patients, wood smoke could cause a different frequency and pattern of mutations in the K RAS oncogene. It is of clinical relevance to determine whether the patients with NSCLC exposed to wood smoke present any differences in the frequency and the type of mutations in the K RAS gene, with respect to both smoking and non smoking patients. Actually, a number of potential biological markers are being investigated with the aim of selecting patients who will receive more specific therapies and thus achieve better results regarding the response to treatment and overall survival. This is why the ability to detect K RAS mutations associated with risk factors for NSCLC could represent a starting point for proposing different treatment approaches and benefiting the patients according to the specific characteristics of each tumor. General Objective: To define the frequency and type of mutations at codon 12 of the K RAS oncogene that occur in patients with non small cell lung cancer who have a background of wood smoke exposure or tobacco smoking. Materials and Methods: The presence of mutations at the K RAS oncogene will be evaluated retrospectively in 50 patients with advanced NSCLC who have a background of wood smoke exposure and 50 patients with NSCLC who have a background of tobacco smoking. Additionally, 50 patients with NSCLC with or without a background of exposure to any of these risk factors for lung cancer will be prospectively evaluated. For the patients that will be prospectively studied, the inclusion criteria will be as follows: patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC stage IIIB,IV who have not received previous chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both and who have tumor tissue embedded in paraffin blocks or formalin fixed; these patients must sign an informed consent letter. The exclusion criteria will be: patients who refuse to participate in the study or those who decide to withdraw from it, patients without tumor tissue or with a poor quality sample. The tumor samples, both formalin fixed or paraffin embedded, used for the histological diagnosis of patients will be obtained from the Pathology Departments of the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases; these samples will be used to gather DNA for the analysis of K RAS mutations. The clinical data of the patients will be obtained from their medical files. DNA extraction: Genomic DNA was extracted by standard procedure from areas of paraffin slides containing >50% tumor using the QIAamp DNAFFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturers instructions. Analysis of K RAS oncogene mutations KRAS gene mutations from the samples were detected by Therascreen RGQ PCR Kit (QUIAGEN, Scorpions ARMS method), according to the manufacturers instructions. For the statistical analysis of results, continuous variables will be presented as arithmetic means, medians, and standard deviations, while the categorical variables will be presented as proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Inferential comparisons will be performed by Students t test and Mann Whitney U test, according to the distribution of data (normal and abnormal) determined by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Either the chi square test or the Fishers exact test will be performed to evaluate significance among categorical variables. Statistic significance will be determined as a p<0.05 value with a two tailed test. Both significant variables and variables with a borderline significance (p<0.1) will be included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.

NCT00579683,Registry for Patients With Acquired Resistance to Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"The purpose of this study is to try to learn more about how small molecule kinase inhibitors work in treating lung cancer. Some early studies have shown that gefitinib, erlotinib and similar drugs are more likely to work if a particular DNA change (also known as a mutation) is found in a protein that is important in lung cancer. This protein is called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Since small molecule kinase inhibitors sometimes stop working, we would like to examine your tumor to learn why these medicines are not working as well. Your tumor will be examined for a variety of things including changes in the DNA of the EGFR. We will also sequence parts of the genes for HER2, HER3, HER4, and KRAS, other proteins thought to be important in lung cancer.","The goal of this protocol is to determine mechanisms of resistance to epidermal growth factor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A number of trials have shown small molecule kinase inhibitors to be active agents in the treatment of NSCLC 1. Clinically these drugs have been noted to produce dramatic but infrequent responses. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor have been shown to correlate with sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib2,3. However, we know that most patients who have initial responses to EGFR TKI eventually progress. The mechanism of acquired clinical resistance to these inhibitors in patients incompletely understood. This is a protocol to study clinical characteristics and biopsy tissue of patients with non small cell lung cancer who have had previous clinical response to small molecule kinase inhibitors and subsequently experience progression of disease.

NCT02759835,"Local Ablative Therapy for Treatment of Oligoprogressive, EGFR Mutated, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer After Treatment With Osimertinib","Background: Some non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have a mutation in a gene that makes a protein called EGFR. This particular cancer can be treated with certain drugs such as erlotinib (Tarceva), gefitinib (Iressa) and osimertinib (Tagrisso). But many tumors become resistant to these drugs because of a second mutation. Researchers want to test if adding local ablative therapy (LAT) extends the benefits of the drug, osimertinib. LAT can include techniques such as surgery, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy or radiation therapy. Objective: To test if re taking osimertinib after LAT is safe, tolerable, and effective for people whose NSCLC has progressed after initial treatment with osimertinib. Eligibility: Adults ages 18 and older with certain types of NSCLC. Participants will be divided into various groups as described below. Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical exam Blood, urine, and heart tests Tumor scans Eye exam Review of tumor sample. Participants will take the study drug by mouth once a day. They will continue until they can no longer tolerate it or their disease worsens. They will keep a dosage diary. All participants will start each 21 day course with physical exam; blood, urine, and saliva tests; and electrocardiogram. They will have scans every 6 weeks and echocardiogram every 3 months. Groups 1 and 2 will: Start osimertinib right away. Have LAT if their disease progresses and is suitable for LAT. If LAT cannot be performed or LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed. Re start osimertinib after LAT, or other treatments if not suitable for LAT. Group 3 will: Have LAT. If LAT consists of a procedure other than surgery, a tumor biopsy will be performed. Start osimertinib after LAT. After participants stop taking the drugs, they will have a final visit. This will include: Medical history Physical exam Blood tests Participants will be called every year for follow up.","Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly improved the response rate (RR) and survival in patients with tumors harboring EGFR sensitizing mutations.. An invariable consequence of treatment with EGFR TKIs is the development of acquired resistance. The most common mechanism of resistance observed in approximately 50% of all cases in patients treated with 1st and 2nd generation EGFR TKIs is the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in exon 20.. Osimertinib is a 3rd generation EGFR TKI designed to target the T790M mutation, which has shown impressive responses in both first and second line settings.. Despite these developments, it is almost certain that selection pressure will lead to the emergence of newer clones that are resistant to treatment with osimertinib. One common mechanism of acquired resistance to osimertinib is the generation of EGFR C797S mutation.. The use of local ablative therapies for patients who develop limited metastatic disease or oligoprogressive disease on EGFR TKI therapy is promising.. We hypothesize that following local ablative therapy to treat oligoprogressive disease after emergence of resistance, osimertinib can be resumed safely and re initiation of osimertinib results in additional progression free survival benefits. Objectives: Determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (as assessed by progression free survival (PFS) upon re initiation of osimertinib following local ablative therapy (LAT) for patients with oligoprogressive disease after treatment with osimertinib. Assess mechanisms of acquired resistance to osimertinib Eligibility: Histologically confirmed advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR sensitizing somatic mutations or a germline T790M mutation and no prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (Cohort 1); OR progressive disease after 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI therapy harboring somatic T790M mutation (Cohort 2); or patients with progressive disease after treatment with osimertinib who are eligible for local ablative therapy (Cohort 3). If biopsy for EGFR mutation status confirmation is not clinically feasible, EGFR mutations may be confirmed by circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analysis using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certified assay.. Presence of measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 2. Adequate end organ function. If patients are not eligible for LAT, they will be referred for standard of care chemotherapy as per treating physicians discretion. These patients may also be considered for other clinical trials. Design: This is a single institution, open label phase II trial of osimertinib treatment in EGFR mutant lung cancer.. Eligible patients not previously treated with osimertinib will be treated with osimertinib daily until disease progression. At the time of progression, patients with oligoprogressive disease (no more than 5 sites of progressive disease) will be assessed for LAT.. If patients are eligible for LAT, osimertinib will be resumed after LAT and they will be followed for second progression on osimertinib (PFS2).. If patients progress at the same site where LAT has been performed before, the progression will be considered to be a result of inadequate ablation and they will be considered for repeat LAT and again re challenged with osimertinib if clinically feasible.. Tumor samples will be obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy. At the time of first progression on osimertinib if a patient is eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then a tissue sample will be obtained for genomic and proteomic studies to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance. For patients who are not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that is not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy will be performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for above studies..

NCT00955149,Erlotinib for Chemoprevention in Trisomy 7 Positive Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC),"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bile ducts of unknown etiology. It is characterized by diffuse inflammation and stricturing of the entire biliary tree, eventually resulting in cirrhosis of the liver. Patients with PSC are at increased risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cancer arising from bile duct epithelium. This risk is estimated to be approximately 1 to 1.5% per year. It is postulated that chronic inflammatory changes in the biliary epithelium promote CCA formation. The prognosis of CCA is fatal. The only potentially curative therapy is surgical; however, only a minority of patients qualify for surgical treatment. Several studies have demonstrated overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in CCA cells. EGFR is a type 1 tyrosine kinase promoting cell proliferation, migration and altered cell adhesion  typical characteristics of malignant neoplasias. In CCA cells, EGFR activation is sustained resulting in cancer progression. In human CCA samples, EGFR expression correlates with higher histologic grade, poor prognosis, and risk of recurrence. The EGFR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p12). Chromosomal abnormalities of the bile duct epithelium, particularly trisomy 7 (i.e. three copies of chromosome 7) can be detected in biliary epithelial samples obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in PSC patients. The finding of cells with trisomy 7 has preceded the development of aneuploidy and multiple chromosomal abnormalities in a number of patients, the latter chromosomal abnormalities are characteristic of CCA. Trisomy 7 amplifies the gene for EGFR thereby presumably promoting overexpression of this growth factor receptor. In a cohort of patients with Trisomy 7 and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis patients followed for 1 year, the rate of development of Cholangiocarcinoma was 35% (n=37, Dr. Gores, unpublished observation). Patients without cytologic abnormalities were at minimal risk for the development of CCA. Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a human EGFR type 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tarceva received FDA approval as single agent treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer. In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 731 patients, receiving 150 mg of Tarceva or placebo once daily, median survival was prolonged to 6.7 months from 4.7 months (p<0.001). Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor expression (45% of total study patients) demonstrated greater survival benefit in EGFR positive patients. Tarceva in combination with Gemcitabine is also FDA approved as first line therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Our central hypothesis is that patients with trisomy 7 will have carcinogenic changes including EGFR overexpression. EGFR blockade will inhibit a growth,survival advantage for these premalignant clones eliminating them from the biliary epithelium. As an initial step towards testing this hypothesis, the tolerability of Tarceva in this patient population needs to be established. This study will assist in determining the safety and tolerability of Tarceva in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. This study will be followed by a Phase 2 randomized controlled trial of Tarceva in patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis with Trisomy 7.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis, Trisomy 7, Cholangiocarcinoma, Chemoprevention, Erlotinib",6 months,Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Prevention,"Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, Trisomy 7, Cholangiocarcinoma, Chemoprevention",Erlotinib (Tarceva)

NCT02889692,Clinical Study of Chinese Medicine Plus Targeted Therapy Maintenance in Advanced Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma,"The investigators performed a randomized, double blind controlled, prospective study method on observation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) combined with targeted therapy maintenance to prolong the efficacy of long term survival of advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients. The investigators plan to involve 200 cases for observation in 3 years (100 cases for targeted therapy maintenance, 100 cases for targeted therapy maintenance plus TCM,), expecting that integrated TCM combined with targeted maintenance therapy has a better efficacy on prolonging progression free survival time, overall survival, improving quality of life(QOL) of patients than that of targeted maintenance therapy.","Maintenance therapy refers to systemic therapy that may be given for patients with advanced NSCLC after 4 to 6 cycles of first line chemotherapy. However, patients are only candidates for maintenance therapy if they have responded to their previous treatment or have stable disease and their tumors have not progressed. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRTKIs) such as Iressa and Erlotinib have proved effective in first or second line therapy for advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Targeted therapy maintenance can be partly extend patients TTP, but the toxicity and the side effects of targeted therapy will decrease QOL. Besides, high cost of targeted therapy will cause greater economic pressure on patients.The investigators preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival time and improve QOL, but high level evidences are needed. The investigators perform a multicenter, randomized, double blind controlled, prospective study in advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with stage Ⅲ～Ⅳ. Advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients after first line chemotherapy will choose maintenance therapy according to the patients wishes, including targeted therapy maintenance, chemotherapy maintenance and TCM maintenance therapy. Patients who choose targeted therapy maintenance are randomized over observational group (TCM granules plus targeted therapy maintenance),and control group (TCM placebo plus targeted therapy maintenance).

NCT02293733,Retrospective Study in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR),"The purpose of our retrospective study is to describe which circumstances EGFR TKI is continued despite progression according to the usual Response Evaluation CrIteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) in patients with EGFR activating mutations and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI .We will collect their social and demographic data (age, sex), first Progression Free Survival ( PFS)  from start of EGFR TKI to 1st progression PFS 1 and  from first progression according to RECIST to second progression : PFS2 , Overall Survival (OS)  from diagnosis OS 1 and from first progression OS 2 , mutational status. We will analyze more closely the mode of progression (site), the therapeutic approach at disease progression. We will define two subgroups: those for whom EGFR TKI was continued at least three months despite progression defined according to RECIST criteria, and those for whom a second line treatment (chemotherapy without EGFR TKI) was chosen at disease progression. It will be individualized the subgroup of patients in whom it was continued TKI after progression.","Background : • Lung cancer represents the leading cause of death by cancer in France. Significant advances have been made in recent years on knowledge of oncogenesis of NSCLC in particularly the discovery of specific oncogenic drivers playing major role in oncogenic addiction responsible for the occurrence of NSCLC. Activating mutations of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR appeared in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC. In 2010, the search for EGFR mutations in patients with lung cancer was performed in 16,834 patients and the mutation rate was 10.5%. The use of specific inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase in patients with activating mutations of EGFR have shown a significant clinical benefit with a response rate more than 70 % ,with PFS ranging from 9 to 13,1 months and median overall survival from 20 to 30 months. Despite these very good results, all patients develop a resistance to EGFR TKI. This progression is usually defined according to RECIST criteria. These RECIST criteria were established primarily on studies conducted in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy with few or no targeted therapies. In addition, the mode of action of TKI (blocking signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metastasis ..) is very different from the mode of cytotoxic action (action during cell division). Thus, the use of RECIST does not seem to be the most appropriate way to evaluate the response in patients treated by TKI. Despite this, the RECIST criteria have been used to demonstrate superiority of EGFR TKI compared to chemotherapy in patients with EGFR activating mutations in first line setting. In 2010, Pr Jackman proposed a clinical definition of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI : Treatment with a single agent EGFR TKI,. Presence of EGFR activating mutation, clinical benefit from treatment with an EGFR TKI. Systemic progression of disease according to RECIST or WHO criteria while on continuous treatment with EGFR TKI within the last 30 days TKI. No intervening systemic therapy between cessation of EGFR TKI and initiation of new therapy. Tony Mok , in the accompanying editorial, made some criticism to this definition. He argued that it was not uncommon to find new small slow growing tumor nodules after the dramatic initial response to EGFR TKIs. He stated that in this situation, EGFR TKIs could be continued with benefit for the patients. Since then, others clinical situations have been described, such as the emergence of one or even more new metastasis located in one single organ (like the brain or bones), which can be controlled by a loco regional treatment. The authors found that the continuation of EGFR TKIs in these cases allowed control of the disease for a considerable length of time. More recently, it has been suggested that even loco regional treatment was not mandatory for EGFR TKIs continuation. Pr Nishino studied retrospectively 56 patients with EGFR activating mutations and acquired resistance. 88% of patients continued EGFR TKI treatment for at least 2 months beyond progressive disease defined according to RECIST criteria. The median time from RECIST progressive disease to termination of TKI for these patients was 10.1 months (range 2.2 to 64.2 months) and the median overall survival was 31.8 months, which is a rather good result. Pr Oxnard, in a similar study, found that in 45% of 42 patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI, alternate systemic therapy could be delayed for three months or more. These 19 patients had more frequently the exon 19 deletion and were free of cancer related symptoms at RECIST progressive disease. Another recently published retrospective Japanese study suggested that continuous use of EGFR TKI beyond progressive disease may prolong overall survival compared with switching to cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with EGFR activating mutations. A prospective ASIAN phase II study (ASPIRATION) has been recently completed. It compared the continuous use of erlotinib versus stopping erlotinib at progression according to RECIST criteria. Patients could continue erlotinib if progression was slow (> 6 months stability), asymptomatic minimal increase and,or new cerebral metastasis controlled locally. The patients switch to another systemic treatment if they had rapid progressive disease, extra brain symptomatic metastasis, deterioration of Performance Status (PS) or life threatening complications. The results of this study should be available in December 2014. Purpose : The purpose of our retrospective study is to describe which circumstances EGFR TKI is continued despite progression according to the usual RECIST criteria in patients with EGFR activating mutations and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI. This study concerns patients who have began a TKI treatment in first line from 1st JANUARY 2010 to 1st JUNE 2012.Well collect their social and demographic data (age, sex), first PFS (from start of EGFR TKI: PFS 1) and second (from first progression according to RECIST 1.1 to second progression : PFS2) , OS (from diagnosis OS 1 and from first progression OS2), mutational status, and we will analyze more closely the mode of progression (site), the therapeutic approach at disease progression. We will define two subgroups: those for whom EGFR TKI was continued at least three months despite progression defined according to RECIST criteria, and those for whom a second line treatment (chemotherapy without EGFR TKI) was chosen at disease progression. It will be individualized the subgroup of patients in whom it was continued TKI after progression. In this subgroup, it will be searched for a correlation between delaying systemic therapy (second line) by pursuing a EGFR TKI at least 3 months and various parameters: Type of EGFR mutation. Symptoms at disease progression. Clinical characteristic. Emergence of new metastases vs increasing size of known targets. Speed of decay and tumour progression (% per month). Delivery of loco regional treatment when relapse occurs in a single site. PFS (PFS1 and PFS2) and OS (OS1) from the first progression in this group will be compared to the general population (population for which there was TKI stop to the progression) with EGFR activating mutations.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Retrospective, EGFR, mutation, TKI, NSCLC",Patients are followed up to 48 Months maximum,,,,NSCLC Non Small Cells Lung Cancer,
NCT01854034,Phase 2 Study of AUY922 in NSCLC Patients With Exon 20 Insertion Mutations in EGFR,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. Investigational means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of cancer or for any use outside of research studies. It has been found that some people with NSCLC have a change (mutation) in a certain gene called the EGFR gene. This mutated gene helps cancer cells grow. The majority of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations achieve good outcomes with erlotinib or other EGFR inhibitor therapies, with a high response rate, prolonged progression free survival and possibly improved overall survival from therapy. However, the 4% of EGFR mutant patients that harbor an exon 20 insertion mutation historically have reaped little benefit from EGFR directed therapy due to the low affinity of this mutation for direct EGFR inhibitors, especially erlotinib and gefitinib (see Yasuda et al, Lancet Oncol 2011). This group of patients is ideal for studying other targeted therapeutic strategies that could affect the oncogene mutation in EGFR via alternative mechanisms. AUY922 is an investigational drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that AUY922 may be effective in killing cancer cells in patients with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of AUY922 and determine how well AUY922 works for participants with advanced NSCLC and exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR.","Interested patients will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that they are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that patients do not take part in the research study. If patients have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history physical exam, performance status, assessment of tumor, EKG, electrocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan, eye exam, blood draw, blood pregnancy test, urine test and collection of a piece of the stored tumor tissue. The study treatment is given in 21 day cycles. AUY922 is given by IV (into a vein). This is called an infusion. Patients will receive an infusion of AUY922 on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle (once per week). The infusion will take about 60 minutes. A schedule of clinic visits for the study is summarized below. Cycle 1, Day 1: physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight; performance status; EKG; blood draw; routine urine test Cycle 1, Day 2: EKG Cycle 1, Day 3: EKG Cycle 1, Day 8: Vital signs, performance status, EKG, questions about side effects and other medications taken Cycle 1, Day 15: Physical exam, including measurement of vital signs, performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken Note that in Cycle 1 patients will need to stay at (or return to) the clinic for the last EKG following the Day 1 AUY922 infusion, and come to the clinic on Days 2 and 3 for EKGs. Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 1: physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight; performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken; routine urine test Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 8: Vital signs; performance status; EKG; questions about side effects and other medications taken Cycle 2 and beyond, Day 15: Physical exam, including measurement of vital signs; performance status; EKG; blood draw; questions about side effects and other medications taken. Additional EKGs may be done at any time if the study doctor thinks it is necessary. A blood test to measure the amount of cardiac enzymes in the blood may be done whenever abnormal findings are suspected or seen on the EKG. Additional tests and procedures: CT or MRI scans will be done to measure the disease about every 6 weeks.. A blood pregnancy test, for women who can become pregnant, will be performed every 6 weeks or at any point in which pregnancy is suspected.. A standard eye exam will be done on Cycle 3, Day 1. Additional eye exams will be done if patients experience any eye related symptoms, such as changes in vision. Within 1 week after the last dose of the study drug AUY922, patients will be asked to return to the clinic. At this visit the following will be done: physical examination, performance status, EKG, ECHO or MUGA scan, blood draw, urine test, eye exam, questions about side effects and other medications taken. Patients will be asked to return to the clinic a second time so investigators can follow up on any ongoing side effects after stopping AUY922.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Advanced disease, EGFR mutation","From the start of treatment until the time of disease progression, median duration of follow up of about 3 months",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,AUY922

Secondary objectives include evaluation of, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, antitumor activity of Gefitinib and Tremelimumab combination. The exploratory objectives are to evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity or prospectively identify patients likely to respond to Tremelimumab and Gefitinib. The biological rationale for such a study is that even though the disease is progressing it is likely that EGFR sensitive clones, although diminished under the pressure from the EGFR TKI, are still present. Therefore, withdrawing the inhibitory pressure of the EGFR TKI can potentially allow regrowth of the EGFR sensitive cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of EGFR resistant clones needs to be suppressed by another therapeutic approach. Until today no association of chemotherapy and TKI EGFR has demonstrated clinical benefit. Moreover, patients may have received chemotherapy and the likelihood of chemosensitivity is very low. So, the association of Gefitinib with immune checkpoint blockade is very attractive and may result in clinical benefit in NSCLC with EGFRmut.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,,Up to 42 days,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Gefitinib, Tremelimumab"

This study will consist of two parts. If you are enrolled in Part One of the study, you will receive AMG 479 and everolimus. If you are enrolled in Part Two of the study, you will receive AMG 479, everolimus, and panitumumab. The study will also look at how the drugs work in the body, and will see if there is any effect on your cancer. The study will have two parts: The first part will be to define the MTD,RPTD of the doublet combination of AMG 479 + everolimus using a standard 3 6 subjects per dose level. Since each agent is known to be well tolerated as monotherapy, we will start with the full dose of AMG 479 and escalate the dose of everolimus. Once the RPTD is established, an additional 20 subjects will be added to confirm the tolerability of this regimen and to allow more detailed biomarker assessment for the effect of each agent alone in the doublet combination. In this biomarker expanded cohort, subjects will start treatment with 2 weeks of AMG 479 monotherapy (a single dose of AMG 479), followed by the combination of AMG 479 + everolimus on day 15. The second part of the study will assess tolerability of the triplet therapy, with panitumumab added to the RPTD of AMG 479 + everolimus, again using a standard cohort size of 3 6 subjects. Finally, at the recommended phase II dose of the triplet therapy, 20 subjects will be added to an expanded safety and biomarker cohort. In this biomarker expanded cohort, 10 subjects will start treatment with two weeks of AMG 479 monotherapy (a single dose of AMG 479), and 10 subjects will start treatment with two weeks of everolimus monotherapy, with all subjects starting the triplet combination therapy with panitumumab on day 15. Two sustained complete responses (one > 2 years of complete response, second >8 months of complete response) were seen in subjects with refractory NSCLC (never smokers) enrolled in the doublet regimen. Therefore, an additional 20 subjects with NSCLC, never smokers or non smokers with ≤ 10 year pack smoking history will be enrolled at MTD,RPTD to further assess safety, tolerability and clinical activity in this specific patient cohort. In this cohort, subjects will start both drugs on cycle 1, day 1. ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS: AMG 479 is an intravenous (I.V., meaning through a vein) medication made from a special type of human protein called antibodies. AMG 479 blocks the activity of another protein called IGF 1R which is important for tumors to grow. Blocking IGFR 1 activity has been shown to slow or kill cancer cells in laboratory studies. AMG 479 is currently being evaluated in clinical research studies in a variety of cancers. AMG 479 is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer and is therefore considered an investigational drug. Everolimus is a pill that works by blocking the activity of a substance in the body known as mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTOR is important for helping the growth and survival in normal and cancer cells. Blocking mTOR activity has been shown to slow or kill cancer cells in laboratory studies. Everolimus is currently being evaluated in clinical research studies in a variety of cancers. Everolimus (AfinitorTM) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (a type of brain cancer), neuroendocrine tumors originating in the lung or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and HER2 negative breast cancer. Besides cancer, everolimus also has been tested for its ability to help block the rejection of solid organs transplants (such as liver or kidney transplants). Everolimus is approved for this purpose in Europe but not in the United States. Panitumumab is another intravenous (I.V.) medication made from a special type of human protein called antibodies. Panitumumab blocks the activity of a protein called EGFr which is also important for tumors to grow. Blocking EGFr activity has been shown to slow or kill cancer cells in laboratory studies. Panitumumab is currently being evaluated in clinical research studies in a variety of cancers. Panitumumab (Vectibix™) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer following 5FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan chemotherapy regimens.",Completed,All,18 Years,90 Years,"Phase I, Solid Tumor, AMG 479, Panitumumab, Everolimus, RAD001, Duke, Subjects with refractory advanced solid tumors, non small cell lung cancer","3 years, 3 years",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Advanced Solid Tumors, Non small Cell Lung Cancer","AMG 479, Everolimus, Panitumumab"

Some chemotherapy may, in some cases, be combined with radiation. This study looks at a different way of treating this type of cancer.. This study is specifically for patients whose lung cancer has changes in a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The study drug, gefitinib, was developed to stop the signals from the EGFR that tell certain types of lung cancers tumors to grow.

In a small subset of tumors, the presence of activating mutations within the ATP binding site confers increased susceptibility to gefitinib, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR. Agents that can inhibit EGFR function through different mechanisms may enhance gefitinib activity in patients lacking these mutations. Mevalonate metabolites play significant roles in the function of the EGFR; therefore, mevalonate pathway inhibitors may potentiate EGFR targeted therapies. Targeting HMG CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme of mevalonate pathway, using lovastatin induces a potent apoptosis in a variety of tumor types.

To assess the toxicity of neoadjuvant Gefitinib treatment in clinical stage 1A & 1B NSCLC. Enrollment Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Patients may be identified by thoracic surgeons, respirologists and,or interventional chest radiologists for study participation upon clinical and radiographic assessment. **Diagnostic biopsy, Pretreatment Investigations If patients have already had a core or FNA biopsy before referral, this material will be sought from the original pathologist for review and inclusion in the study with appropriate consent sought. If a patient does not have a biopsy upon presentation to the thoracic surgeon, and consents to inclusion in the trial, baseline non invasive assessment will be carried out before a percutaneous biopsy will be mandated as part of entry into the study. After non invasive staging, patients will be subject to biopsy. In collaboration with pathology, an immediate diagnosis will be made at the time of fine needle aspiration biopsy (or bronchoscopy). After a pathologic diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, subjects will be invited to have additional biopsies will be performed to obtain material for correlative studies, assuming no complications or technical difficulties have arisen. These studies will be done in collaboration with thoracic interventional radiologists from Diagnostic Imaging, who supervises the lung fine needle aspirates and biopsies. All patients will undergo pre study assessments for symptoms, performance status, radiographic assessment and blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and renal function tests). Assessment of response will occur after the 4 week treatment period. Toxicity will be assessed continuously, with patient assessment weekly on treatment, repeat blood tests at 2 weeks and imaging of measurable disease at 4 weeks. All subjects will be invited to have their initial diagnostic biopsy and subsequent surgical tumor specimen examined as part of the laboratory correlate component of the study. Patients will be considered evaluable for pharmacodynamic assessment if they complete at least 21 of the planned 28 days of therapy. Once competed, oral Gefitinib will be administered at a dose of 250 mg (1 pill) daily for 28 days prior to the planned mediastinoscopy. Patients may take the pill either with or without food, and are encouraged to take the medication at approximately the same time each day. If the patient forgets to take a dose, they should take the last missed dose as soon as they remember, as long as it is at least 12 hours before the next dose is due. If patient vomits after taking the dose, the dose may be retaken if the tablet is seen in the emesis. The last dose of Gefitinib will be administered not less than 48 hours prior to mediastinoscopy or surgery. If the mediastinoscopy reveals the presence of Stage III disease, the patients mediastinoscopy samples may still be analysed as part of the correlative study. Patients will be followed for 90 days or as long as required after the last dose of Gefitinib to ensure resolution of any Gefitinib related toxicities. However these patients will be offered standard therapy for stage III disease off of study protocol, for example a combination of chemotherapy, radiation plus or minus surgical resection. If these patients do proceed to thoracotomy post chemotherapy and,or radiotherapy, their resection specimen will not be eligible for this correlative protocol. **Duration of Therapy and Follow up As outlined above, patients will be treated for 28 days before surgery and will also be followed for 90 days post operatively after thoracotomy to ensure the recovery from surgery.

NCT02475720,Survey on the Treatment Reality of Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation positive Non small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC),"According to the recent report using EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI), there is all over survival of the EGFR gene mutation positive NSCLC in a tendency to extension. However, the real situation and the reason are not clarified.This observational study collects the data of EGFR gene mutation positive NSCLC approximately 2,000 from the medical record of approximately 20 facilities in Japan and observes the treatment reality of EGFR gene mutation positive NSCLC.","Study Site(s), number of subjects and countries planned Approximately 2000, Advanced Non Small Cell Lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients who fulfil the inclusion,exclusion criteria will be recruited by 10 to 20 investigational sites in Japan. Total planned Study period Estimated date of first subject in June , 2015 Estimated date of last subject in November , 2015 Estimated date of data base lock December, 2015 Estimated date of first subject in for investigation of survival January, 2016 Estimated date of last subject in for investigation of survival March, 2016 Estimated date of data base lock for investigation of survival March, 2016 Medicinal Products (type, dose, mode of administration) and concomitant medication Not applicable Study Rationale As its benefits in EGFR mutation positive patients have been reported, EGFR TKI is now recommended by guidelines as standard first line therapy for EGFR mutation positive patients. Back then when concomitant use of platinum medication and 3rd generation cytocidal drug was the standard therapy, treatment was of very poor prognosis, 8 to 10 months in terms of median overall survival, and a 1 year survival rate of 30% to 35%. Then, gefitinib was approved in July 2002. Takano et al. reported that survival among patients with EGFR mutation positive non small cell lung cancer has been getting longer after approval of gefitinib. The overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation positive non small cell lung cancer was 27.7 months in gefitinib group of Study North East Japan (NEJ) 002 reported by Inoue et al. in 2013, 34.8 months in gefitinib group of Study West Japan Oncology Group (WJOG) 3405 reported by Yoshioka et al. in 2014, 36.3 months in patients receiving erlotinib in Study Japan Oncology (JO) 22903 reported by Katakami et al. in 2014, and 46.9 months in afatinib group and 35.8 months in chemotherapy group of the Japanese subset in Study Lux Lung3 reported by Kato. According to recent reports, overall survival tends to be prolonging, but the actual situation and the reason for such tendency has not been revealed. Thus, we planned the present study, which clarify the prognosis, patient characteristics and treatment regimen of the patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC to provide useful information in order to promote individualized therapy for the patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC.

NCT01633645,Bortezomib in Combination With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,The primary objective of this study is to establish the objective response rate (complete response + partial response) following treatment with VELCADE in combination with cisplatin plus gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIb) or metastatic (stage IV non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior antineoplastic therapy for advanced disease,"By its mechanism of action i.e., inhibiting protein degradation, VELCADE targets a wide range of pathways that are relevant to tumor progression and therapy resistance. Preclinical data in cell lines indicate anti tumor activity in NSCLC. Preliminary work in vivo (animal models) suggests an enhanced anti tumor effect in combination with cytotoxic agents commonly used in the treatment of lung cancer, including gemcitabine and CPT 11 and additive tumor growth delay when combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Platinum or non platinum based combinations including the newer agents represent the standard front line treatment for patients with stage IIIB,IV NSCLC. However, despite the introduction of the newer agents, the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy seems to have reached a plateau. The incorporation of molecularly targeted agents in NSCLC treatment is likely to improve the treatment outcomes. Recently, an initial Phase 2 of VELCADE in combination with gemcitabine,carboplatin in the first line treatment of NSCLC was completed. A response rate of 21% with impressive progression free survival and overall survival rates of 5 and 11 months, respectively, were reported. Combining VELCADE with a currently approved standard regimen such as cisplatin,gemcitabine, may lead to a better response rate, TTP, and OS than chemotherapy alone. VELCADE combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin has been shown safe in a phase I trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VELCADE was 1 mg,m2 on either a weekly or a biweekly schedule when combined with gemcitabine 1000 mg,m2 and cisplatin 70 mg,m2. Treatment was generally well tolerated with the weekly regimen of VELCADE being associated with less myelotoxicity. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of gemcitabine and cisplatin were not altered by VELCADE. Interestingly enough, among 27 patients with NSCLC an encouraging response rate of 37% and disease stabilization rate of 52% was recorded. In this trial VELCADE alone will be administered on the first treatment cycle to examine molecular correlates of VELCADE activity. Subsequent cycles will include the combination of VELCADE with cisplatin plus gemcitabine. Data from the phase I study of VELCADE plus cisplatin,gemcitabine contributed to the selection of the drug doses for patients that will be enrolled in the current study. Specifically, the doses employed are those identified as the MTD level of the phase I study. The anti tumor activity of the combination of VELCADE and cisplatin,gemcitabine in the first line treatment of NSCLC will be tested in this study according to a Simon 2 stage optimal design.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,Up to 9 weeks,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Metastatic","Bortezomib, Gemcitabine, Cisplatin"

Primary objective of the studys Randomization Part:  To assess the efficacy of cilengitide in combination with cetuximab and platinum based chemotherapy (cisplatin,vinorelbine or cisplatin,gemcitabine) compared to cetuximab and platinum based chemotherapy alone in terms of progression free survival (PFS) time. Study design and plan: This is a multicenter, open label, randomized, controlled Phase II study with a safety run in part in subjects with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). During the safety run in, the regimen was intensified stepwise by cohort (cilengitide intravenous i.v. 1000 milligram mg to 2000 mg twice a week) in a classical 3+3 subjects (for each platinum based chemotherapy regimens separately) approach with predefined dose and schedule reduction rules. In the safety run in 12 subjects were included and evaluated for safety and feasibility of different escalating doses of cilengitide administered twice weekly in combination with cetuximab, cisplatin and vinorelbine or gemcitabine. After completion of the safety run in, the randomized part will be started, during which all subjects will receive cetuximab and platinum based chemotherapy (cisplatin,vinorelbine or cisplatin,gemcitabine). Subjects will be centrally randomized on a 1:1 basis to either Group A or C; Group B will be closed with implementation of Amendment No. 4 (dated 20 December 2010): • Group A: Cilengitide 2000 mg once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 3 week chemotherapy cycle) in combination with cetuximab and platinum based chemotherapy that will consist of the following: Cetuximab once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), plus cisplatin on Day 1 and vinorelbine on Days 1 and 8 of every 3 week chemotherapy cycle, or. Cetuximab once weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), plus cisplatin on Day 1 and gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 of every 3 week chemotherapy cycle. The decision which of the 2 chemotherapy regimens will be applied for a given subject is at the discretion of the treating investigator. • Group B: Cilengitide 2000 mg twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of every 3 week chemotherapy cycle) in combination with cetuximab and platinum based chemotherapy as described for Group A.

NCT04487457,Prospective Study to Evaluate the Blood Kinetics of Immune Cells and Immunosuppressive Cytokines After Exposure to an Immunity Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI): Study of the Impact of Chemotherapy,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological form, accounting for 85% of all bronchopulmonary cancers (PBC). The advent of Immunity Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) targeting Programmed cell Death 1 (PD 1) is changing current treatment algorithms. Preliminary results from work carried out in the Medical Oncology Department of the University Hospital of Tours suggest that immunotherapy targeting ICI, when administered beforehand, increases the effect of catch up chemotherapy. In NSCLC, the progression free survival (PFS) of 3rd line chemotherapy after anti PD 1 immunotherapy was better than the PFS of 3rd line chemotherapy performed at the end of conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy gives paradoxically better results than immunotherapy alone. Immunotherapy restores the anti tumor T immunity inhibited by the cancer cell. While the mode of action of ICIs is well known, the mechanisms of resistance to them are poorly understood. Several pathways are evoked, in particular the modulation of cellular interactions within the tumour microenvironment (TME), the molecular expression profile of cancer cells, or the immunological status of the patient. Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) participate in the maintenance of immune system homeostasis by ensuring tolerance to self antigens. Within TME, Treg inhibit anti tumor T cell activity and potentiate tumor proliferation. The latter, by specifically recognizing tumor antigens, block the activity of effector T lymphocytes directed against tumor cells. Thus, an increase in circulating Treg concentrations and in TME is a poor prognostic factor, especially in NSCLC. Gemcitabine chemotherapy is commonly used in the management of NSCLC. Recent data show that gemcitabine decreases Treg activity and regulates levels of anti inflammatory TME cytokines such as IL10, TGF β and interferon Ɣ. The hypothesis of this study is that the decrease in Treg blood concentration by catch up chemotherapy restores sensitivity to immunotherapy.","Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histological form, accounting for 85% of all bronchopulmonary cancers (PBC).

NCT02991482,PembROlizuMab Immunotherapy Versus Standard Chemotherapy for Advanced prE treated Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,Trial comparing standard treatment (chemotherapy) with pembrolizumab treatment in patients with advanced pretreated malignant mesothelioma.,"Mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy usually affecting the surfaces of body coelomic cavities. It most commonly originates from the pleura with a propensity to the lower parietal pleura and costo diaphragmatic recess, and is almost always caused by asbestos exposure, with a usual lag time of 30 years between exposure and presentation. Outcomes for most patients are invariably fatal, with median survival from presentation around 9 12 months in most series due to difficulties in achieving a complete microscopic surgical resection and tumour relative chemo refractoriness. Whilst initially considered rare, due to the demand of asbestos of all varieties associated with industrialization following the Second World War, the background incidence of mesothelioma of 1,million has risen to 40,million in some countries. In the UK, where substantial asbestos exposure continued until the 1970s, the death rate is the highest in the world with a current epidemic of new cases, predicted to continue for another 5 10 years. Two main histological subtypes of mesothelioma are identified. The epitheliod subtype is the commonest, accounting for around 40% of cases, whilst the sarcomatoid subtype is observed in 20% of cases; the latter being typically aggressive and chemorefractory. Around 35% cases have features of both epitheliod and sarcomatoid subtypes and are termed biphasic subtype. For patients with pleural mesothelioma, in whom surgery is not considered appropriate, systemic chemotherapy (platinum combined with pemetrexed) remains the international standard of care. Cisplatin,pemetrexed is associated with a response rate of 41% and confers an OS advantage of 3 months over cisplatin alone, and is the only licensed systemic therapy for mesothelioma in Europe. Despite this, the median survival is 9 12 months from most series in unresectable cases. At relapse, after platinum based chemotherapy, no anti cancer systemic therapies are licensed. Whilst several small phase II studies and retrospective series have suggested potential efficacy for chemotherapy with agents including carboplatin,gemcitabine, or vinorelbine, none thus far have demonstrated efficacy benefit in a randomised study, with median PFS rates reported of about 3 months for both gemcitabine and vinorelbine. There is therefore a huge unmet need for effective therapy for patients with relapsed pleural mesothelioma. The largest trial ever performed of systemic therapy in relapsed pleural mesothelioma in 661 patients documented the natural outcome of this group of relapsed mesothelioma patients, reporting a median OS of 27.1 weeks (6 months) and median PFS for 6.1 weeks (1.5 months) for placebo. Programmed cell death 1 (PD 1) is a co inhibitory molecule at the immunological synapse that acts as a major regulator of adaptive immunity, and is exploited by tumour cells to result in adaptive immune resistance (tolerance). This occurs when PD 1 binds to the ligands PD L1 (B7H1) or PD L2, which are expressed on many tumour types. High PD L1 expression on tumours is associated with poorer outcomes. Mesothelioma has been shown to express PD L1, with a small study identifying PDL1 expression in up to 40% of mesotheliomas. Moreover, immunologically mediated inflammation is known to be a key driver for mesothelioma development via the Nalp3 imflammasome. Pembrolizumab (MK 3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4,kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD 1 and its ligands, PD L1 and PD L2. There is a need to identify new ways for the systemic therapy of malignant mesothelioma and immune checkpoint inhibition is a promising way forward. Results from the proposed trial will contribute to overcoming tumour specific immune suppression with immune checkpoint inhibition.",Completed,All,18 Years,,MPM,Time from randomization of the first patient until database cutoff date for the primary PFS analysis (Sep 2017  Feb 2019; approximately 1.5 years).,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Pleural Mesothelioma Malignant Advanced,"Pembrolizumab, Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine"

NCT01352962,"Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and Lenalidomide for Treatment of Advanced,Metastatic Urothelial Cancer and Other Solid Tumors","Background:  Gemcitabine and carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used to treat several types of cancer, including cancer of the pancreas, bladder, ovaries, and lung. Lenalidomide, a drug that prevents the growth of new blood vessels in tumors, has been approved for treatment of certain blood cancers, but it has not yet been approved for use in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin. Researchers are interested in determining the safest and most effective dose of this combined form of chemotherapy for solid tumors, particularly for urothelial cancer (tumors of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis). Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for solid tumor cancers.. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin as a treatment for urothelial (bladder) cancer. Eligibility: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatments.. Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with urothelial cancer that has not responded to standard treatments. Design: Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.. Participants with urothelial cancer will receive lenalidomide alone for the first 14 days of a 21 day cycle before starting the first full treatment cycle.. All participants will receive gemcitabine on days 1 and 8, and carboplatin on day 1 only, of every 21 day treatment cycle. Lenalidomide will be taken daily at home for the first 14 days of each cycle. Participants will be asked to take aspirin or other medications to prevent the possibility of blood clots.. Participants may receive up to six cycles of treatment with this combination. If after six cycles the cancer has not grown or has shrunk, participants may continue to take lenalidomide alone for an additional 6 months (total of 12 months of therapy) or until the cancer recurs.. Participants will be monitored with blood samples, physical examinations, and tumor imaging studies through the cycles of treatment.. After the end of the last treatment cycle, participants will have followup visits every 3 months for the next 18 months, then every 6 months for another 18 months, and then yearly.","BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine plus carboplatin is an accepted first line therapy in patients unfit for cisplatin chemotherapy with metastatic urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumor malignancies.. Both non clinical and clinical data support targeting angiogenesis in urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.. Both non clinical and clinical data support targeting the immune system in urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors.. Lenalidomide has both anti angiogenic and potent immunomodulatory properties.. Lenalidomide has been safely coadministered with cytotoxic therapy in patients with solid tumors and non clinical studies demonstrate possible synergy with gemcitabine. OBJECTIVES: Primary  To establish the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide which can be safely combined with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with advanced,metastatic UC and other solid tumors that are unfit for cisplatin. Secondary To preliminarily evaluate the progression free survival, response rate and overall survival in patients with advanced,metastatic UC and other solid tumors treated with the combination of lenalidomide, gemcitabine, and carboplatin.. To determine the effects of treatment on a set of 4 laboratory parameters (including Treg, sIL 2R, VEGF and CTC.) in the expansion cohort of patients with bladder cancer treated at the MTD. ELIGIBILITY: Adult patients with histologic documentation of an advanced solid tumor with unresectable or metastatic disease.. Urothelial cancer patients should be ineligible for cisplatin based on one or more of the following:. Calculated creatinine clearance of < 60 mL,min (but greater than or equal to 30 mL,min). Solitary kidney. Karnofsky Performance Status < 80%. No prior combination systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease allowed for patients with UC, except single agent radiosensitizing chemotherapy (not considered prior systemic therapy), or prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (including cisplatin based) is allowed provided if it was completed (Bullet) 6 months prior to diagnosis of metastatic disease; or prior intravesical therapy is permitted. Up to 1 line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is permitted for non UC patients.. Laboratory evaluation must meet safety requirements, including a creatinine clearance greater than 30 using the Cockroft Gault formula; may not be pregnant or breast feeding. DESIGN: This is a single institution phase I study of gemcitabine (1000 mg,m2 on days 1 and 8) and carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) plus escalating doses of lenalidomide (GCL) in patients with advanced,metastatic UC and other solid tumors ineligible for cisplatin therapy. Lenalidomide will be administered once daily on days 1 through 14 every 21 days at escalating dose. An expansion cohort at the MTD of an additional 15 patients with bladder cancer will be enrolled in order to determine whether there are differences between pre treatment and post treatment levels of the following parameters: Treg, sIL 2R, VEGF and CTC.. Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin in combination with lenalidomide unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who achieve stable disease, a partial response, or a complete response after completion of 6 cycles will be eligible to continue lenalidomide alone at the same dose and schedule until disease progression. Restaging evaluations will occur after every 3 cycles of treatment (approximately 9 weeks).. Based on a standard 3+3 design with 4 dose levels per cohort, a maximum of 24 patients, with the potential for an additional 3 patients with CrCl>60 mL,min, may need to be evaluated to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide in this combination therapy.

NCT02797977,"A Phase 1,2 Trial SRA737 in Combination With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin or Gemcitabine Alone in Advanced Cancer Subjects","The purpose of this clinical study is to establish the safety profile, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend a Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine; and to evaluate the efficacy of SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine in prospectively selected subjects with genetically defined tumors that have predicted sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition based on factors including: genetic profiling of tumor tissue or ctDNA, HPV status, and germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene status. Specific cancer indications that frequently feature these factors will be studied. Preclinical and clinical data support the hypothesis that active doses of SRA737 may be strongly potentiated by sub therapeutic doses of gemcitabine, which should lead to clinical efficacy. To test this hypothesis, SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine is being explored in this study.","SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DNA Damage Response (DDR) replication stress response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress (RS) is induced by factors such as oncogenes (e.g., CCNE1 or MYC), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or FA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other genomic alterations. This replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic RS. The critical role of Chk1 in mediating cellular responses to RS affords the opportunity to combine SRA737 with sub therapeutic concentrations of the RS inducing agent gemcitabine. Low concentrations of gemcitabine cause a prolonged cell cycle S phase and induce hallmarks of RS without inducing overt cytotoxicity. Gemcitabine profoundly depletes DNA replication building blocks and targets proliferating cells by inducing RS through induction of stalled replication forks. In response, Chk1 has an important role in stabilizing and preserving replication fork complexes in the context of RS, preventing catastrophic replication fork collapse and double strand breaks. Extensive preclinical data, as well as clinical data, support the synergistic interaction between Chk1 inhibition and gemcitabine. The purpose of this clinical study is to: establish the safety profile, determine the MTD, and propose a RP2D and schedule for SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine. In addition, the study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 in combination with low dose gemcitabine in prospectively selected subjects with tumors that have predicted sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. This clinical study consists of three phases: A Standard Dose Triplet Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1. This phase, which has concluded, evaluated a triplet combination of SRA737 with standard dose gemcitabine and cisplatin in subjects with solid tumors.. A Low Dose Gemcitabine Combo Dose Escalation Phase 1. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects are being given escalating doses of SRA737 on an intermittent schedule in addition to low dose gemcitabine until the combination MTD is reached. The dose or frequency of gemcitabine may also be reduced during this process and alternative dosing schedules for SRA737 may be considered. When the MTD or a minimum efficacious dose range has been achieved for SRA737, or when evidence of anti tumor activity is observed, the gemcitabine dose may be escalated with corresponding decreases in the SRA737 dose as necessary for safety.. A Low Dose Gemcitabine Combo Cohort Expansion Phase 2. After the MTD and,or RP2D has been identified, the trial will explore the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 plus low dose gemcitabine in prospectively selected subjects with tumors that harbor genomic alterations linked to increased replication stress and that are hypothesized to be more sensitive to Chk1 inhibition via synthetic lethality. Enrollment for expansion cohorts may alternatively begin prior to the completion of dose escalation and determination of MTD or RP2D, if there is evidence of anti tumor activity or if the minimal plasma concentration of SRA737 is maintained above a threshold at which sustained Chk1 inhibition is anticipated at 24 hours after dosing. This phase is targeting enrollment of genetically selected patients into four expansion cohorts from specific indications that are predicted to have a high prevalence of such alterations, including locally advanced or metastatic: high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC),. small cell lung cancer (SCLC);. soft tissue sarcoma (STS); and. cervical,anogenital cancer. To qualify for enrolment into these cohorts, the subjects tumor must have evidence of predicted sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition based on factors including: For subjects with HGSOC, documented somatic or germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type status will confer eligibility without requirement for prospective genetic profiling. If documented BRCA status is not available, genetic profiling may be performed prospectively to determine eligibility.. Subjects with SCLC are eligible without requirement for prospective genetic profiling on the basis of very high prevalence of cancer related alterations in the tumor suppressor genes (eg, TP53 and RB1) in this population. For subjects with STS, and any others for whom genetic profiling is performed prospectively, eligibility will be determined by the sponsors review of genetic abnormalities detected in genes in the following categories: Key tumor suppressor genes regulating G1 cell cycle progression,arrest such as RB1, TP53, etc.. The DNA damage response pathway including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, mismatch repair genetic alterations and,or high microsatellite instability.. Genetic indicators of replicative stress such as gain of function,amplification of Chk1 or ATR or other related gene.. Oncogenic drivers such as MYC, CCNE1, etc.. For subjects with anogenital cancer, known HPV positive status will confer eligibility without requirement for prospective genetic profiling. If HPV status is not known or not positive, genetic profiling (or HPV testing where appropriate) may be performed prospectively to determine eligibility.

Subjects enrolled in this trial will receive 3 investigational drugs: SGI 110 (guadecitabine), durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab.","SCLC accounts for approximately 15% of new cases of lung cancer, and an estimated 33,000 cases are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Compared to NSCLC, SCLC typically has a more rapid doubling time, a higher growth fraction, and earlier development of distant metastases. Patients with limited stage (LS) disease are treated with curative intent using definitive, concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy. For patients with extensive stage (ES) disease, systemic chemotherapy can prolong survival in most cases, however long term survival is rare. Despite the activity of several agents in SCLC, an etoposide plus platinum (i.e. cisplatin) doublet regimen remains the standard of care in the first line setting because of its higher activity compared to other chemotherapy regimens, as well as the ease of combining it with radiation. Initial response rates may be as high as 70 90% in LS SCLC and 50 70% in ES SCLC. However, the disease typically recurs rapidly which is reflected by median survival rates of 9 to 11 months for ES SCLC and a 2 year survival rate of less than 5%. This study has a 3 + 3 design that will be used to assess the safety of SGI 110 given prior to flat doses of durvalumab (1500 mg) and tremelimumab (75 mg).

NCT02879760,Oncolytic MG1 MAGEA3 With Ad MAGEA3 Vaccine in Combination With Pembrolizumab for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients,"This is a Phase 1,2, multi center, open label, dose escalation trial of Ad MAGEA3 and MG1 MAGEA3 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer who have completed a first standard therapy with at least 1 cycle of platinum based chemotherapy and,or at least one treatment of PD 1 or PD L1 antibody targeted therapy.","This is a Phase 1,2, open label, dose escalation trial of Ad MAGEA3 and MG1 MAGEA3 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC (histological subtype of squamous and non squamous NSCLC). In Phase 1, patients who have progressed after treatment with a platinum based regimen and,or PD 1,PD L1 targeted antibody therapy will be enrolled. In Phase 2, only patients who have progressed after treatment regimen containing PD 1,PD L1 targeted antibody therapy will be enrolled. In the Phase 1 portion of the study, MG1 MAGEA3 treatment will be escalated in a sequential dose escalating design. In the Phase 2 portion of the study, MG1 MAGEA3 treatment will be at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the maximum feasible dose (MFD). The Ad MAGEA3 and pembrolizumab dose is fixed in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the trial. Phase 1 Enrollment Cohorts 1 through 5: Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined below, is observed. Patients will be observed for a DLT through Day 29. After enrollment of the first patient in each cohort, 2 additional patients will be enrolled after the initial patient reaches Day 29 without experiencing a DLT. Treatment with MG1 MAGEA3 will proceed to the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a DLT. If one of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, additional patients will be enrolled until a second patient experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until 6 total patients have been treated, whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not experienced within that cohort, dose escalation may continue. If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose level immediately preceding that dose will be determined as the MTD. Ad MAGEA3 will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection at a dose level of 2 x 1011 virus particles (VP) on Day 1. MG1 MAGEA3 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at escalating dose levels on Day 15 and Day 18. In Cohorts 1 through 5, patients will receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg IV on Day 22, and every 3 weeks thereafter until confirmed radiographic progression or unmanageable toxicity. Cohort 6: Upon determination of the MTD,MFD (safety assessment) in Cohorts 4 5, the treatment regimen will next be optimized such that pembrolizumab will begin on Day 1 (concurrent treatment). The Day 15 and Day 18 doses of MG1 MAGEA3 will be the doses defined as the MTD,MFD in either Cohort 4 or5. Specifically, the regimen evaluated in Cohort 6 is as follows: Day 1: Patients will receive 2 x 1011 VP IM of Ad MAGEA3 and 200 mg IV of pembrolizumab (the Pembrolizumab will be continued every 3 weeks Q3W).. Day 15: Patients will receive IV MG1 MAGEA3 at the MTD,MFD established for the first infusion from Cohort 4 or Cohort 5.. Day 18: Patients will receive IV MG1 MAGEA3 at the MTD,MFD established for the second infusion from Cohort 4 or Cohort 5.. Three patients will be treated according to the dose schedule above unless a DLT is observed between Day 1 and Day 29, at which time three additional patients will be enrolled onto this cohort. If 2 DLTs occur within these six patients treated in Cohort 6, this cohort will be stopped and a new Cohort will be initated again with patients treated concurrently with pembrolizumab but with a 0.5 log lower dose of MG1 MAGEA3 than used in Cohort 6 for the Day 15 and Day 18 doses. Phase 2 Enrollment Phase 2 enrollment will commence upon completion of dose escalation and determination of the MTD,MFD. In Stage 1 of the 2 Stage design, 18 evaluable patients will be treated at the MTD,MFD (this will include patients treated at the MTD,MFD in Phase 1 who meet Phase 2 inclusion criteria). If 1 or more patients respond, the study may continue to Stage 2, and an additional 14 evaluable patients will be enrolled for a total of 32 evaluable patients. A patient will be defined as being evaluable for the primary endpoint (EPPE) and included in the Simon 2 stage study design if they are seronegative to adenovirus Type 5, the virus used in the prime. Preliminary data from two other Turnstone Ad,MG1 MAGEA3 trials indicates that patients without pre existing anti adenovirus antibodies (seronegative) prior to treatment have a greater likelihood of generating MAGEA3 specific T cell responses than those that are seropositive at baseline. Therefore, this study is designed to primarily determine the response rate and clinical outcome for this homogenous population of Ad5 seronegative patients whom are most likely to benefit from Ad,MG1 MAGEA3 treatment. However, there is a small subset of seropositive patients who developed significant anti MAGEA3 T cell responses after Ad,MG1 MAGEA3 treatment. In addition, the presence of Ad5 seropositivity would not be expected to have any significant impact on the potential benefit of MG1 MAGEA3 tumor oncolysis. Therefore, exploratory data on clinical and immune response in the Ad5 seropositive population will be conducted and the study will enroll both Ad5 seronegative and positive patients. It is anticipated that approximately half of the patients enrolled will be seronegative to Ad5, therefore Stage 1 of the Simon 2 stage design above will enroll approximately 18 patients and Stage 2 will enroll approximately 14 patients. Total study enrollment is projected to be between 2 and 100 patients. Safety Committee: Prior to each dose level increase or the initiation of Phase 2, a safety committee composed of independent voting members and treating physician(s) will review toxicity and other relevant data to determine suitability of dose escalation or expansion with regards to patient safety. Interim assessments of toxicity will be conducted throughout the trial to monitor for safety trends and identify any new or increased toxicity not previously associated with the IPs.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Lung, Cancer, Chemotherapy, Oncolytic virus, Immunotherapy, Pembrolizumab, Keytruda","7 months, 7 months",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Ad MAGEA3, MG1 MAGEA3, Pembrolizumab"

Pembrolizumab, is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD 1 on T cells with its ligands PD L1 and PD L2. Anti tumor activity with an acceptable side effect profile have been shown in melanoma and NSCLC. Radio labeling of pembrolizumab with the positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclide 89Zirkonium (89Zr) enables serial non invasive imaging and quantification of distribution of PD 1 in melanoma patients. By performing a 89Zr pembrolizumab PET scan prior to treatment with pembrolizumab, the uptake of the tracer in the tumor lesions and normal organ distribution can be evaluated, this could lead to new insights about heterogeneity of PD 1 expression, as well as the use of a 89Zr pembrolizumab PET as a complementary tool for patient selection in the future. Objective: Primary objective: To evaluate whole body distribution of 89Zr pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or NSCLC. Secondary objectives: i) To evaluate pharmacokinetics of 89Zr pembrolizumab; ii) To assess the heterogeneity of 89Zr pembrolizumab tumor uptake; iii) To describe safety of 89Zr pembrolizumab; iv) To correlate the tumor response of pembrolizumab, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) according to standard RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator, with specific tumor tracer uptake. Study design: This is a two center, single arm, investigator sponsored trail (IST) with the PET tracer 89Zr pembrolizumab to evaluate in vivo whole body distribution of 89Zr pembrolizumab in a registered indication for locally advanced metastatic melanoma or NSCLC before Pembrolizumab treatment. Study population: Eligible are patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or NSCLC, who are eligible to receive Pembrolizumab treatment and who have at least one tumor site that is accessible for a tumor biopsy. Intervention : In part A of the imaging trial, a dose finding imaging study will be performed to assess the optimal tracer protein dose of 89Zr pembrolizumab and the optimal interval between tracer injection and scanning. Approximately 3 cohorts of about 2 3 patients each will undergo 89Zr pembrolizumab PET imaging before start of treatment with pembrolizumab. In part B, 12 eligible patients will undergo 89Zr pembrolizumab PET imaging at baseline, with the optimal tracer protein dose and scanning schedule as determined in part A. In total, a maximum of 21 patients will be included.The purpose of part B of the study is to analyze the whole body distribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 89Zr Pembrolizumab. Tumor and normal organ radioactive tracer uptake will be quantified as standardized uptake values (SUV). Tumor biopsies will be collected at baseline and studied for various characteristics including Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL 1), PD 1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Pembrolizumab treatment will be administered as standard of care Main study parameters,endpoints: To evaluate whole body distribution of 89Zr pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: For this imaging study patients have to make maximal 6 extra visits to the clinic for screening, to receive tracer injection and for maximal 3 PET,CT scans and the biopsy before start of standard treatment with pembrolizumab. The study ends after the last imaging or biopsy (whichever comes first) and will approximately take 7 days. Whenever possible, all procedures that are part of the study protocol will be planned during regular visits to the hospital as part of care as usual. 89Zr pembrolizumab PET,CT implements a radiation burden of about 20 millisievert (mSv), and 1.5 mSv per low dose CT scan. Besides PET imaging, patients will be asked to give in total 12 blood samples (85 mL), which will give minor discomfort. A metastases biopsy will be performed, preferably from an easily accessible lesion to minimize the burden and risk for the patient. Based on a literature review, the risk of tumor biopsies is considered low with a small risk on significant,major complications or death. The risk associated with the 89Zr pembrolizumab seems minor and although patients do not directly benefit from this study, results of this study will be valuable for our understanding of the tumor immune response and will guide further prospective research.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Pembrolizumab, PET imaging, Melanoma, Non small cell lung cancer",1 year,,Single Group Assignment,Diagnostic,"Melanoma, Non small Cell Lung Cancer","89Zr Pembrolizumab, 89Zr Pembrolizumab PET"

NCT02085070,MK 3475 in Melanoma and NSCLC Patients With Brain Metastases,The purpose of this trial is to study the activity of MK 3475 in untreated brain metastases from melanoma or non small cell lung cancer.,"While recent advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) with agents targeting PD 1 are striking, there remains a significant need to develop therapies for patients with untreated brain metastases who were excluded from prior trials with MK 3475 and the majority of other studies in these diseases. The brain is a common site of disease spread in many solid tumors, most notably metastatic melanoma and NSCLC. 10 40% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases during their lifetime and >75% have brain metastases at autopsy. Overall, historical melanoma patient cohorts have reported a median survival of patients with brain metastases in the order of 2.5  4 months despite use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery. One older patient series showed a median survival of < 4 months in melanoma patients with brain metastases and a neurological death rate of >30% despite the treatment of intracranial metastases with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Among those with NSCLC, 10% have brain metastases at presentation and another 30% develop them over the course of their disease. Survival after the development of brain metastases is as dismal in those with NSCLC as it is for melanoma. Multifocal disease is common in both of these diseases, with about half of patients with CNS disease presenting with more than one brain lesion. Patients with untreated brain metastases have been excluded from most clinical trials of systemic therapy for two reasons: (1) historically their prognosis has been poor (overall survival ≤ 4 months) and (2) experimental drugs are presumed to not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) or BBB penetration is not well studied. In melanoma, for example, one phase III study evaluating ipilimumab excluded patients with untreated brain metastases and another study evaluating ipilimumab and dacarbazine excluded all patients with a history of brain metastases, regardless of prior treatment. A subsequent trial with ipilimumab for patients with untreated brain metastases indeed showed that the drug had some activity in treating CNS disease. In the initial vemurafenib studies, patients with progressing or unstable CNS metastases were excluded. The pivotal BRIM 3 trial excluded patients with brain metastases unless metastases had been definitively treated more than three months prior to trial enrollment. Both temodar and sorafenib cross the BBB. Initial studies with sorafenib alone and in combination with chemotherapy excluded patients with active brain metastases. A combination study of temodar and sorafenib in patients with or without brain metastases showed modest activity in patients without a history of prior temodar, and was thought to be favorable in part due to local therapies. Although a number of studies have been conducted for melanoma patients with untreated brain metastases using established therapies, most initial clinical trials with novel agents exclude these patients. A recent trial with dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated B raf, is an exception to the long standing paradigm. A phase I,II study of this agent included a subset of patients with untreated brain metastases. At the 2010 meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, Long et al reported that nine of the ten patients with untreated cerebral metastases enrolled in this trial had shrinkage of their brain lesions. This was the basis for a recent phase II trial of dabrafenib specific for patients with untreated brain metastases61. In NSCLC, a small number of trials have shown that combination chemotherapy regimens can induce a response in the CNS with untreated brain metastases with a median PFS up to 4 months. These studies demonstrate that asymptomatic brain metastases, similar to asymptomatic metastases in other sites, can be treated systemically on clinical trials, and that drug activity in the CNS is not necessarily different than in other metastatic locations. Current standard of care for brain metastases that require immediate local intervention (based on symptoms, location, size, or other concerning features) is craniotomy with resection or radiation therapy. As an adjunct to standard craniotomy, LITT is emerging as a new, minimally invasive local therapy to treat previously surgically inaccessible brain metastases. Not only is cell death instantaneous, thus decreasing the risk of delayed intra tumoral hemorrhage, but another theoretical advantage of using LITT as part of management of brain metastases is that the hyperthermia breaks down the blood brain barrier at the edge of the coagulation region thereby possibly increasing access of chemotherapeutic agents into the lesion. In patients in whom either craniotomy or LITT are performed, biopsies of tumor and surrounding normal brain can also be obtained at the time of local therapy. The purpose of this trial is to study the activity of MK 3475 in untreated brain metastases from melanoma or NSCLC. Given the promising initial results of MK 3475 in these diseases but the lack of data in patients with untreated brain metastases thus far, this trial will study treatment in this patient population. Additionally, for patients with melanoma this trial requires local therapy with craniotomy or LITT to at least 1 brain lesion prior to systemic therapy, thereby allowing the acquisition of brain tumor tissue for correlative studies on biomarkers that may be predictive of clinical response in the CNS and systemically. There will also be a biopsy of an extra cerebral metastasis when feasible, particularly when tissue from the brain lesion is not obtained in patients with NSCLC. Upon results entry, the primary outcome measure was aligned as originally presented in the study protocol (attached with results).",Completed,All,18 Years,99 Years,,8 weeks,Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Melanoma, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, Brain Metastases",MK 3475

NCT03224871,UCDCC#269: A Pilot Study of Interlesional IL 2 and RT in Patients With NSCLC.,"The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising evidence for deep and durable responses with these agents the majority of patients fail to respond. The investigators hypothesize that a novel strategy combining radiotherapy and intralesional interleukin 2 (IL 2), a signaling molecule and member of the cytokine family involved in the activation of leukocytes and lymphocytes, may overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy and offer significant clinical benefit to patients who fail to respond to checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators propose a microtrial testing the feasibility of a bold combinatorial immunotherapy strategy consisting of radiotherapy (RT), intralesional IL 2, and check point blockade for metastatic non small cell lung cancer patients who have progressed after checkpoint inhibition. IL 2 can upregulate PD 1 expression and activate T cells.","The advent of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the promising evidence for deep and durable responses with these agents the majority of patients fail to respond. The investigators hypothesize that a novel strategy combining radiotherapy and intralesional interleukin 2 (IL 2), a signaling molecule and member of the cytokine family involved in the activation of leukocytes and lymphocytes, may overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy and offer significant clinical benefit to patients who fail to respond to checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators propose a microtrial testing the feasibility of a bold combinatorial immunotherapy strategy consisting of radiotherapy (RT), intralesional IL 2, and check point blockade for metastatic non small cell lung cancer patients who have progressed after checkpoint inhibition. IL 2 can upregulate PD 1 expression and activate T cells. There is data supporting combination therapies with IL 2 and checkpoint blockade, IL 2 and radiotherapy, and checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy but clinical data is limited and the triple combination has never been tested. IL 2 + checkpoint blockade was recently tested in a small clinical trial and showed promising results but RT was not included in this trial. As outlined above RT has been demonstrated to increase the efficacy of both IL 2 and checkpoint blockade. The investigators believe that the triple combination of radiotherapy + IL 2 + checkpoint inhibition will be highly effective as RT + IL 2 can serve highly activate the immune system and checkpoint blockade can reverse the immune suppressive pathways induced by tumor and therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of intralesional IL 2 with radiotherapy will act as an in situ vaccine inducing an anti tumor immune response. The investigators further hypothesize that this vaccine effect will convert patients with primary or secondary resistance to checkpoint blockade into responders since one mechanism of resistance to checkpoint blockade appears to be lack of a pre existing anti tumor immune response. The primary endpoint is tolerability, safety and toxicity. Exploratory endpoints include abscopal response rate, objective response rate, disease control rate, progression free survival, and correlative studies. This trial will incorporate robust correlative assays to provide insights into mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint blockade and how this therapy may overcome that resistance. This trial, although small, has the potential to drastically advance both our understanding and treatment of metastatic lung cancer. This is a pilot phase I study that will evaluate the safety and toxicity of this combinatorial approach. Eligible patients with NSCLC who fail to respond to PD1,PDL1 checkpoint blockade will be enrolled. Patients will continue on checkpoint blockade and receive intralesional IL 2 in combination with hypofractionated radiotherapy. Radiotherapy will be delivered to the treatment lesion during the first week of therapy using an 8 Gy x 3 fractions palliative regimen. Fractions may be delivered on consecutive or every other day but must be completed during week 1 and will not be repeated in future cycles. Immune checkpoint blockade will be started on week 1 day 1, concurrent with radiotherapy and continue with cycles every 2 (nivolumab) or 3 (pembrolizumab) weeks. A total of four Interleukin 2 treatments will be delivered into the treatment lesion by intralesional injections twice weekly starting 24 72 hours after the completion of radiotherapy and to be completed no later than study Day 21. Intralesional injections will be performed by palpation of the lesion or under ultrasound or CT guidance as indicated. Intralesional IL 2 injections will follow guidelines, which we have previously published. Briefly, each patient will receive an initial test dose of 3 x 106 IU of IL 2, which will be escalated to 7 x 106 for the second treatment and then 15 x 106 IU for the final two treatments as tolerated. If a dose level is not tolerated the treatment will be de escalated to previous dose levels for subsequent treatments. If 3 million IU IL 2 is not tolerated the dose can be de escalated to 1 million IU IL 2. If 1 million IU IL 2 is not tolerated the treatment will be deemed intolerable and patient removed from study.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,Beginning of treatment to up to 12 months after beginning of treatment.,Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,METASTATIC NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER,"Intralesional IL 2, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Radiotherapy"
NCT04793815,Lung Cancer Cryo Activation as a Novel Approach to Augment Immunotherapy Efficacy (CRYOVATE),Cryo activation involves the insertion of a cryoprobe in the tumor bed with subsequent cell necrosis and tumor antigens release. Such technique has the potential to induce immune specific reactions influencing cancer cells outside of the ablated region. The addition of cryo activation to immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) in the advanced NSCLC setting could represent a synergistic therapeutic avenue in order to potentiate treatment responses,"Innovative ablation techniques have gained momentum in the last decade in order to offer alternative approaches to patients not amenable to conventional surgery. Cryoablation, a procedure by which tumor cell death is induced through cycles of freezing and thawing, represents such a pioneering technique. The procedure involves the insertion of a cryoprobe in the tumor bed with subsequent application of very low temperatures leading to cell necrosis and tumor antigens release. In the absence of significant heat related denaturation seen in other ablative therapy techniques (microwave, radio frequency, steam, HIFU, etc.) and as intracellular content remains in circulation following cryo activation, it is hypothesized that such technique has the potential to induce immune specific reactions influencing cancer cells outside of the ablated region. This phenomenon would be reminiscent of the abscopal effect, a reaction mediated by locoregional radiotherapy exposure with the potential to trigger a systemic immune response prompting metastatic disease regression. While such immune activation would in itself be insufficient to eradicate tumor cells at distant sites, the addition of immunotherapy through checkpoint inhibition in the advanced setting could represent a synergistic therapeutic avenue in order to potentiate treatment responses in patients with NSCLC. A phase I,II clinical trial will be conducted in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryo activation therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC amenable to anti PD 1 monotherapy (i.e. PD L1 ≥50%).",Completed,All,18 Years,,"NSCLC, Cryo activation, Anti PD 1","every 8 weeks (until disease progression or for a maximum pembrolizumab treatment duration of 2 years), every 3 months thereafter (for up to a total of 5 years)",,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Non small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic, Cryotherapy Effect","Cryo activation, Pembrolizumab"

Despite these numerous successes, PD 1,PD L1 checkpoint blockade therapies do have a number of shortcomings. Many approaches to predict response to PD 1,PD L1 checkpoint therapy have been investigated with limited success. Recent efforts exploring the utility of quantitative imaging biomarkers to predict response to PD L1 immunotherapy have shown promise. The purpose of this retrospective multicenter study is to develop a multi omic classifier to predict response to PD 1,PD L1 checkpoint blockade for mutation negative (EGFR, ALK and ROS1) NSCLC","Recent Phase III studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of atezolizumab (PD L1) in metastatic triple negative breast cancer 3 and small cell lung cancer, while the standard of care for Stage III non small cell lung cancer has changed with positive results of the PACIFIC Phase III study, where durvalumab (PD L1) administered after chemoradiation showed a significant increase in overall survival. Low response rates, generally in the 15% to 20% range in most diseases when used as a single agent, high therapy cost globally ($150,000 or more per year in the U.S) and serious immune mediated adverse events, particularly when PD 1,PD L1 inhibitors are combined with the CTLA 4 inhibitors (ipilimumab). Unpredictable and low patient response rates coupled with high drugs costs and serious toxicities can significantly burden healthcare systems, third party payers and patients. Clearly, diagnostic tools to stratify patients according to response likelihood are necessary as PD L1 checkpoint inhibitors continue to gain adoption. The standard of care biomarker is an immunohistochemistry (IHC) test that measures levels of the PD L1 protein expressed in tumor samples. Tumor mutational burden, presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and inflammatory cytokines are being explored in multiple clinical trials involving PD (L)1 often in combination with additional immuno oncology (IO) therapies In such an approach, a non invasive imaging scan can provide insight and information on the patients entire tumor burden rather than a sample of a subset of lesions (as provided by biopsy or serum based assays). When diagnostic images that depict all treatable lesions are further analyzed with computational techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, resulting in the identification of relevant imaging biomarkers, an accurate overall assessment of patient response to PD L1 therapy may be attainable.",Completed,All,18 Years,100 Years,,during one month,,,,Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),

NCT04037462,Induction of Sensecence Using Dexamethasone to Re sensitize NSCLC to Anti PD1 Therapy,"Lung cancer accounts for 30% of all cancers among American war Veterans and remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths. Half of all lung cancers are metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a 2 year survival rate of 10%. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to harness the immune system to fight lung cancer. However, given the modest response rates of 20 25% to these immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is a greater desire to extend their benefits to more patients. Along with the desire to extend their benefits, there is a critical need for the development of novel approaches that can expand the benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and create more durable responses, prolonging survival from lung cancer. The investigators studies show that extended dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induces irreversible cell cycle blockade and a senescence phenotype through chronic activation of the p27Kip1 gene in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma (AC) cell populations. Further, following withdrawal of Dexamethasone, proteins associated with the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) strongly attracted and expanded T cells, NK cells and monocytes stimulated tumor cell cytolytic activity of NK cells. Therefore, dexamethasone may induce a persistent senescence phenotype in tumor cell sub populations expressing moderate,high levels of GR and resultant chemokines produced by the senescent cells will mobilize host immune cells to reboot response to immune checkpoint inhibitors following complete Dexamethasone withdrawal.","Lung cancer accounts for 30% of all cancers among American war Veterans and remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths.

Further, following withdrawal of Dexamethasone, proteins associated with the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), particularly CCL2, CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL2 strongly attracted and expanded T cells, NK cells and monocytes stimulated tumor cell cytolytic activity of NK cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that in lung adenocarcinoma patients who are not on baseline steroids, pre treatment with Dexamethasone will induce a persistent senescence phenotype in tumor cell sub populations expressing moderate,high levels of GR and resultant chemokines produced by the senescent cells will mobilize host immune cells to reboot response to immune checkpoint inhibitors following complete Dexamethasone withdrawal. The investigators will test this hypothesis through the conduct of the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Use FLT PET imaging and blood analysis to test whether a 7 14 day pre treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with Dexamethasone followed by Dexamethasone withdrawal will induce persistent senescence related cell cycle arrest in 1 lesion in 60% of patients, (based on GR expression) accompanied by release of SASP proteins and activation of T and NK cells. Specific Aim 2: Test whether a 7 14 day pre treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with Dexamethasone followed by Dexamethasone withdrawal and subsequent re challenge with pembrolizumab will yield an overall response rate (ORR) of 33% to pembrolizumab in association with tumor GR status, SASP and immune cell activation. These aims will be conducted through a Phase II clinical trial designed as a single arm two stage study in Veterans whose lung adenocarcinoma has progressed on immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on the investigators preliminary data, the investigators expect that Dexamethasone will induce tumor senescence in at least one lesion in 60% of patients and secondarily improve overall response to pembrolizumab by 33%. Success with these aims would inform a larger study that could potentially change the way the investigators approach patients with primary or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors with an off the shelf medication that could re sensitize lung adenocarcinoma to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of patients.","Capmatinib has been approved in the USA and Japan. In France, a compassionate use for capmatinib has been approved in June 2019 for patients with MET alterations, including METex14 mutations and MET amplification. In March 2021, 204 patients are or have been treated with compassionate use capmatinib as part of this program, most of them (n=175) harboring a METex14 mutation. So far, data on activity and safety of new generation MET TKIs are still sparse and only based on prospective clinical studies. The CapmATU study is a unique opportunity to describe patients characteristics and outcomes, and confirm effectiveness of capmatinib in a large cohort of METex14 NSCLC. Moreover, it will provide original real world evidence (RWE). RWE can be used in oncology to further characterize the safety and efficacy of drugs in the post marketing setting. This may include confirmation of clinical benefit for regulatory purposes, expansion of labeling claims to new indications, testing of alternate doses and schedules of drugs, and assessment of drug activity in biomarker defined subgroups and other special populations. This may be even more important in the context of METex14 NSCLC patients since no real world data with new generation MET TKIs have been reported so far. Indeed, this study will allow to determine whether the antitumor activity of capmatinib reported in the GEOMETRY MONO 1 study can be observed in less selected patients. Given the older age and associated comorbidities of METex14 NSCLC patients, most of them may not be eligible to a clinical trial, thus emphasizing the need for real world evidence. Finally, the biological part of this study (CapmATU BIO) will offer opportunity to identify biomarkers of sensitivity or acquired resistance to capmatinib, which is a poorly explored field of research so far. In this context, the objectives of this non interventional retrospective French population base study are to describe the characteristics of patients with MET dysregulated NSCLC, assess effectiveness and safety of capmatinib in these patients and identify biomarkers of benefit from capmatinib.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Expanded access program, Capmatinib, MET TKIs, IFCT",2 years,,,,"MET Alterations, Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, METex14 Mutations",Capmatinib

If you are in Group 1, you will receive alemtuzumab by vein over 2 hours or through an injection under the skin every day on Days 1 4 of the induction phase and about 1 time every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase.. If you are in Group 2, you will receive tocilizumab by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 or Day 2 of the Induction phase. Tocilizumab will not be given in the Maintenance Phase. Participants in both Groups 1 and 2 will receive etoposide by vein about 1 time each week during the induction phase. You will not receive it in the maintenance phase unless the disease stops responding to the study drugs. At that point, you may begin to receive etoposide again. The study doctor will tell you more about this. The length of time it takes to infuse the study drugs will be different from patient to patient and will depend on rate of injection. Your doctor will discuss this with you. Participants in both Groups 1 and 2 will receive dexamethasone by vein on Days 1 7 of the induction phase. After this, you will take pills of dexamethasone every day during the induction phase. In the maintenance phase, you will take these pills 3 times each week with at least a day between each dose (for example, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). Your dose of the study drugs may be raised, lowered, and,or delayed if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If the disease involves the central nervous system during the Induction phase, you may receive methotrexate. Methotrexate is given 1 time a week for 5 weeks. Study Visits: You will have physical exams on the following days: Day 1,. Every week for the first 4 weeks,. Every 2 weeks during the next 4 weeks,. Every 4 weeks during the next 16 weeks, and. Every 8 weeks after that. Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests on the following days. During the first 4 weeks, these tests must be performed at MD Anderson. After that, these can be performed at a local clinic: Day 1,. Two (2) times each week for the first 4 weeks,. Every week for the next 4 weeks,. Every 2 weeks for the next 16 weeks, and. Every 4 weeks after that. You will have a bone marrow aspiration,biopsy 4 weeks after starting the study treatment and then every 4 12 weeks after that. At any time that the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have additional blood draws or bone marrow aspirations,biopsies to check the status of the disease. If you receive treatment for longer than 24 weeks, the timing of these procedures may be changed if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. Length of Study: You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your participation on the study will be over after the follow up visits. End of Study Visit: If you are taken off or if you leave the study before you have received treatment for 24 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed within 30 days (+, 7 days) of the last dose of the study drug: Blood (about 2 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease. If you cannot make it to MD Anderson for this visit, these procedures may be done with a local doctor and the records can be forwarded to the study doctor. Follow Up: If you respond to the study drugs, you will be followed every 3 6 months for up to 5 years after completion of treatment. You will be called and asked about how you are doing.

NCT01183065,Study of Pralatrexate With Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid Supplementation for Previously Treated Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC),"The purpose of this study is to find out if the experimental drug pralatrexate with the vitamins folic acid and vitamin B12 might be an effective treatment for head and neck cancer. The reason we are doing this study is because another drug called methotrexate has been used for a long time to treat head and neck cancer patients. Pralatrexate was designed by scientists to be a new drug that works better than methotrexate. Laboratory studies have shown that pralatrexate works better than methotrexate at killing cancer cells. Pralatrexate has already been studied in patients with other types of cancers, such as lymphoma and lung cancer. The results from those studies were promising. Pralatrexate was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a new treatment for a cancer called peripheral T cell lymphoma.",,Completed,All,18 Years,,"Pralatrexate, Vitamin B12, Folic Acid, 10 112",2 years,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Head and Neck Cancer,Pralatrexate With Vitamin B12 and Folic Acid
NCT00215046,Vinblastine and Methotrexate in Children With Pulmonary Vein Stenosis,"To evaluate the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents vinblastine and methotrexate in the treatment of two groups of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis. Group 1 will contain children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis who do not have structural heart disease, and Group 2 will consist of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis and concomitant structural heart disease. The primary outcome variable for efficacy is patient status one year after the start of treatment, where status is classified as either failure or success. Failure is defined as death or evidence of progressive obstruction at any time over the course of treatment as defined in the protocol. Success constitutes complete or partial response to treatment or stability of disease. Secondary outcome variables for efficacy are survival, time from diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis until failure, and change in patient classification on a scale measuring the severity of the obstructive disease. 1.2 To assess the safety of vinblastine and methotrexate in the treatment of multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis. The primary outcome variable for safety is any occurrence of toxicity related to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agents over the treatment period.","We sought to develop a regimen that might successfully suppress myofibroblastic proliferation in infants and children with progressive pulmonary vein stenosis. A number of factors need to be considered when proposing novel treatment options for patients with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis. Specifically: Treatment should be directed against a specific target, in this case excessive proliferation of myofibroblasts.. Treatment should have known activity against the target cell.. Treatment should be well tolerated in the patient group. In this case, agents with minimal hemodynamic side effects would be preferred.. Treatment should not preclude patients from participation in other potentially effective therapies. Specifically, agents that do not cause significant myelosuppression would allow listing for transplantation.. Treatment should not interfere with normal growth and development, and should have minimal if any risk for long term toxicity or second tumors. After considering these factors, we chose to administer two chemotherapeutic agents, vinblastine and methotrexate. Vinblastine and methotrexate have over 30 years of usage and are well tolerated. The agents used are given in low dose and do not usually cause nausea or vomiting, nor do they cause significant immunosuppression which, if present, could lead to a risk of infection and fever. Desmoid tumors, also referred to as infantile fibromatosis, overlap with infantile myofibromatosis. A combination of standard agents that has been successfully used to treat desmoid tumors in infants is vinblastine and methotrexate (24). As opposed to cyclophosphamide based regimens, this combination has the distinct advantages of few acute side effects and no known long term toxicities, such as infertility or second malignancy. These agents have been used for over 30 years to treat infant and childhood malignancies. Over the last five years, methotrexate and vinblastine have been used to treat 9 children with recurrent desmoid tumor, a lesion similar although not identical to the abnormality present in patients with pulmonary vein stenosis. This regimen had minimal acute toxicity limited to mild to moderate nausea (which is easily controlled with anti emetic therapy), minimal alopecia, mild hepatic inflammation, and mild myelosuppression. An addition advantage is that these drugs do not interfere with listing for lung transplantation, an important factor in the overall treatment options for this patient population. Instead of high dose administration of chemotherapy (that catches only those cells in cycle at the time of administration), the low dose chronic weekly administration continues to catch proliferating cells as they continually come into cycle. This may explain why the only other trial of chemotherapy (with high dose cytoxan) was unsuccessful. Of the 9 children with desmoid lesions who received vinblastine and methotrexate therapy, four patients were treated for 18 months or longer. At the time of the last report, no patient had progressive disease during therapy. Two children had radiographically stable disease 1 and 2 years after treatment. Two children had stable disease for 1 and 2 years after treatment and then had disease progression. Thus, this drug combination is well tolerated, has minimal side effects, and has demonstrated clinical activity against a closely related type of lesion.",Completed,All,,21 Years,"vinblastine, methotrexate",1 year,Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Intraluminal Pulmonary Vein Stenosis,"Vinblastine, Methotrexate"
NCT03839537,Exposure of Taxi Drivers to Ultrafine Particles and Black Carbon Within Their Vehicles,"Brief Summary Short description of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include a brief statement of the study hypothesis. (Limit: 5000 characters) Example: The purpose of this study is to determine whether prednisone, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide are effective in the treatment of rapidly progressive hearing loss in both ears due to autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). This project is part of a research field on the role, not yet fully understood, of atmospheric pollution, especially from road traffic, on respiratory health and allergies, particularly on the development , onset of symptoms and functional disturbances. The ultrafine fraction of particles (UFPs  particles smaller than 100 nm in diameter) is of recent interest because of their ability to induce inflammatory effects, oxidative stress and may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms in susceptible individuals. UFPs, with their high number concentration and surface area and their small diameter are able not only to convey other contaminants, but also to contribute to a high deposition efficiency, into the alveoli in the lungs. Recently it appeared relevant to be interested in black carbon (BC), components of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers), suspected of being responsible for their toxicity. Current epidemiological knowledge of the effects of UFPs and BC are few as compared to those on fine particles. Some professionals, such as police, drivers (taxis, truckers ...), delivery men, postal workers, workers on roads and highways, etc. are heavily exposed, during their working hours, to air pollution due to road traffic. These occupational groups appear to be at greater risk for developing respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases than the general population. Occupational exposure to diesel exhaust has been associated with an increased risk of lung cancer mortality and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Occupational exposure to UFPs and BC has rarely been measured due to a lack of suitable devices. Therefore, this projects originality consists in measuring UFPs and BC by using portable devices developed in the recent years. The use of these devices, linking their recordings with ventilatory measures and repeating them, offers the rare opportunity to study the short term respiratory health impact of this occupational exposure, which has never been described in the literature. Our research aims to: 1, quantify the occupational exposure of taxi drivers to UFP, BC, oxides of carbon (CO, CO2) and to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 2, identify spatio temporal variability and patterns of exposure related to occupational tasks, 3, study the impact of this occupational exposure to UFP and BC on ventilation performances and respiratory symptoms.","The study is based on a random sampling of 100 taxi drivers, working full time day shift, in Paris, members of three Trade Unions. It will be conducted over a period of two years in warm and cold season. The research will begin with an inclusion clinical examination. It consists on determining the overall health status of the participants by administering a standardized questionnaire and performing spirometry test, prick test and FENO measurement. The exposure assessment will be based on continuous measurement of UFP, BC, carbon monoxide (CO) and NO2, by portable devices during a working day (± 11 hours). On the same day, two spirometry tests and two measurements of exhaled carbon monoxide will be performed at the beginning and at the end of the shift, using handheld devices. Multivariate analysis will provide spatio temporal distributions of individual exposures and their determinants. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) multivariate models will be used to determine the relation between exposure (UFP, BC) and respiratory symptoms, ventilation performances, adjusting for potential confounding,modifying factors.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Ultrafine particles, black carbon, taxi drivers, respiratory function test, occupational exposure","6 months, 6 months, 36 months, 36 months, 36 months, 36 months, 36 months",,Single Group Assignment,Screening,Pulmonary Ventilation,"Exposure measurement, Spirometry test, Exhaled carbon monoxide test, Skin allergy test, Spirometry test, Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Testing"
NCT02648724,Sym015 (Anti MET) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies,This is the first study to test Sym015 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym015 is safe and effective for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies without available therapeutic options.,"In the first part of the study (Part 1, dose escalation), Sym015 was evaluated for safety and tolerability. Additionally, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was to be determined. Sym015 was given at different dose levels on an every second week (Q2W) dosing schedule. Each patient was given one single weight based dose level. In the second part of the study (Part 2, dose expansion), dosing was to be at the RP2D on a Q2W dosing schedule. Three cohorts were included: Basket Cohort: Patients with KRAS wild type (WT) advanced solid tumor malignancies with MET amplification and without therapeutic options.

NCT00051311,Modified Stem Cell Transplant Procedure to Treat Patients With Blood and Immune System Cancers,"This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified stem cell transplant procedure for treating cancers of the blood and immune system. Patients with cancers and pre cancerous conditions originating in blood or immune system cells can sometimes benefit greatly from, and even be cured by, transplants of stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into blood cells). In addition to producing new bone marrow and restoring normal blood production and immunity, the donated cells fight any residual tumor cells that might have remained in the body, in what is called a graft versus tumor effect. However, severe problems, and sometimes death, may follow these transplants as a result of the high dose chemotherapy and radiation that accompany the procedure. Also, donated immune system cells called T cells sometimes attack healthy tissues in a reaction called graft versus host disease (GVHD), damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin. This study will use the following strategies to try to reduce these risks: induction chemotherapy to reduce patients immunity in an attempt to prevent rejection of the donated stem cells;. reduced intensity conditioning chemotherapy that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression;. donation of immune cells called T helper type 2 (Th2) cells instead of T cells to try to reduce the risk of serious GVHD;. treatment with methotrexate and cyclosporine to try to reduce the risk of serious GVHD. Patients between 12 and 75 years of age with non Hodgkins lymphoma, Hodgkins lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplasia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history, physical and dental examinations, blood and urine tests (including a blood test for genetic match with the donor), lung and heart function tests, and X ray studies. A bone marrow biopsy may be done to evaluate disease status. Patients with lymphoma may have a nuclear medicine test called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Participants will have a central venous line (large plastic tube) placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body and be used during the entire treatment period to deliver the donated stem cells and give medications, including chemotherapy and other drugs, antibiotics and blood transfusions, and to withdraw blood samples. Treatment will start with induction chemotherapy, which will include the drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Some patients may also receive an antibody called rituximab. Patients will receive one to three cycles of this treatment, depending on their response to the drugs. (One cycle consists of 5 days on drug therapy followed by a 16 day rest period.) Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will start conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Three days after the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells will be infused. To help prevent GVHD, patients will take four doses of methotrexate (by vein) shortly after the transplant, and cyclosporine (by mouth or by vein) for about 6 months after the transplant. The average hospital stay for stem cell transplantation is 3 to 4 weeks. After discharge, patients will return for frequent follow up visits for 3 months. Monthly visits will be scheduled for the next 3 months, then every 3 months for the next 18 months, and less frequently for a total of at least 5 years post transplant. These visits will include bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, blood draws, and other tests to monitor disease status.","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially curative for refractory hematologic malignancies, but its application has been limited historically by morbidity and mortality from conventional transplant preparative regimens and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Donor T cells mediate GVHD and also help to eradicate malignancies through an immune dependent graft versus tumor effect. Efforts to decrease preparative regimen toxicity have led to reduced intensity or nonmyeloablative regimens, facilitating the study of allogeneic HSCT in a broader population. As a promising strategy for reducing GVHD, donor T helper type 2 (Th2) cells were shown to abrogate T helper type 1 (Th1) mediated GVHD without impairing engraftment in murine models of allogeneic HSCT. These findings led to a phase I,II clinical study of donor Th2 cells for the prevention of GVHD during reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT (CC 99 C 0143); preliminary results suggest that a randomized trial will be necessary to evaluate donor Th2 cells further. In CC 99 C 0143, a novel induction chemotherapy regimen, etoposide phosphate, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (EPOCH) Fludarabine (EPOCH F), was well tolerated and effective for sequential host immune depletion. However, a significant proportion of patients failed to achieve satisfactory disease control before transplant, providing a basis for intensifying this induction regimen. Furthermore, the initial 20 patients treated on this study experienced relatively high rates of acute GVHD and considerable morbidity associated with cyclosporine monotherapy for GVHD prevention, indicating that future studies should use more aggressive prophylaxis. These observations warrant modifying our approach to allogeneic HSCT before undertaking a randomized study of donor Th2 cells. We now propose a pilot study of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) matched, related, reduced intensity allogeneic HSCT in refractory hematologic malignancies, using an intensified etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (EPOCH F) induction chemotherapy regimen with rituximab added for patients with cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)+ malignancies fludarabine, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin plus with or without rituximab (DA EPOCH F,R). This regimen will be evaluated for toxicity and disease control before transplantation. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of a standard dual agent regimen, cyclosporine,methotrexate; the impact of this change on hematopoietic recovery, donor,recipient chimerism, and the incidence of acute GVHD will be assessed. Immune reconstitution following allogeneic HSCT is an important research interest among Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch Investigators. Current evidence suggests a critical role for interleukin 7 (IL 7) in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell homeostasis, and interleukin 15 (IL 15) appears crucial to cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell and NK cell homeostasis. The relationships between these cytokines and lymphocyte subpopulations have not been studied in the setting of allogeneic HSCT; such analysis may enhance our understanding of engraftment kinetics, graft versus host disease, and immune reconstitution. We will correlate serum IL 7 and IL 15 levels with changes in circulating T cell and natural killer (NK) cell subpopulations during EPOCH F,R induction chemotherapy, after transplantation, and with the development of GVHD.",Completed,All,18 Years,75 Years,"Lymphoma, Leukemia, Hodgkins Disease, Multiple Myeloma, Immunotherapy","At least 100 days of follow up post reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST), At least 100 days of follow up post reduced intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST)",Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Hematologic Neoplasms,"Stem cell transplantation, Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone, Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, Apheresis"

NCT00003838,Specialized Blood Cell Transplants for Cancers of the Blood and Bone Marrow,"The are a variety of cancerous diseases of the blood and bone marrow that can be potentially cured by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Diseases like leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are among the conditions that can be treated with BMT. Some patients with these diseases can be treated with medical chemotherapy alone. However, patients who relapse following chemotherapy are usually not curable with additional chemotherapy treatments. The only option known to provide a potential cure if this occurs is BMT. Allogenic transplants are cells collected from relatives of the patient. The transplant requires additional high intensity chemotherapy and radiation in order to destroy cancerous cells. In the process, many normal bone marrow cells are also destroyed. This is the reason for transplanting stem cells. The stem cells help to build new functioning bone marrow, red cells, white cells, and platelets. In addition, the immune cells from the donor are implanted into the recipient s body and help to fight off infection and kill remaining cancerous cells. Unfortunately, the powerful doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy associated with allogenic BMT have toxic side effects and often make BMTs too dangerous to attempt in many patients. In order to reduce the complications of BMT, and make it a safer available option for patients with cancers of the blood and bone marrow, researchers have developed a new approach to the BMT. In this study researchers plan to use stem cells collected from the blood stream of patient s relatives rather than from the bone marrow (blood progenitor,stem cell transplant). In addition, researchers plan to use low doses of chemotherapy and no radiation therapy to reduce side effects. The majority of the cancer killing effect will be the responsibility of the stem cell transplant rather than the chemotherapy.","Patients with malignant and non malignant hematologic diseases including severe aplastic anemia (SAA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute and chronic leukemias, Hodgkins and non Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) can now be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This curative effect has been ascribed to the use of high dose chemo radiotherapy and the anti tumor or anti bone marrow effect of the allograft. Dose intensification of conditioning regimens in attempts to reduce disease recurrence has been largely unsuccessful because of increased toxicity and mortality. Indeed, most evidence now points to donor derived T cells as being the principal modality leading to the complete eradication of both malignant and non malignant host hematopoietic cells. The assumption that successful allogeneic BMT relies on the myeloablative effect of intensive but hazardous chemo radiotherapy has largely restricted this therapeutic modality to patients with malignant or life threatening hematologic disorders under the age of 55 years. Treatment related mortality increases substantially with age, prior intensive treatment with chemo radiotherapy, worsening performance status, and co morbid medical conditions. An unacceptable risk of death from conventional BMT renders many patients ineligible for what may otherwise be curative therapy. Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the existence of donor derived CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes with specific reactivity for the patient s leukemia. These cells provide a potent graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. This GVL effect is best seen in patients with CML relapsing after BMT, where a single infusion of donor lymphocytes has been shown to induce complete remission. In addition to the potent anti leukemia effect of these cells, there is now strong evidence that donor T cells are capable of completely eradicating residual host hematopoietic cells in a non myeloablative transplant setting (graft versus marrow) leading to successful and complete donor hematopoietic engraftment. Non myeloablative allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplants are currently being investigated in phase I,II trials assessing engraftment efficacy and toxicity at a number of transplant centers. Preliminary data, including our own experience with greater than 150 patients undergoing this type of procedure, have shown a high rate of complete donor engraftment with a low toxicity profile. Two recent studies investigating non myeloablative allo transplantation in standard risk patients revealed an extremely low rate of transplant related complications and mortality. The decreased risk of transplant related complications associated with non myeloablative transplants expands the eligibility of transplant candidates as well as opens the possibility to evaluate non myeloablative regimens in patients at high risk for complications with standard transplantation. Besides hematologic malignancies, allogeneic BMT has been shown to be curative in a number of debilitating hematologic diseases which may behave in a relatively indolent fashion, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). However, the 30% risk of treatment related mortality (TRM) with standard myeloablative allotransplantation usually precludes these patients from potentially curative therapy, because of concerns about shortening life in patients with these disorders. In this protocol we investigate non myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in two groups of subjects where standard allogeneic transplantation is considered to have unacceptable toxicity. Group A: Subjects with hematologic malignancies with factors putting them at high risk for transplant related complications and mortality, including prior intensive chemo radiotherapy and co morbid diseases. Group B: Subjects with hematologic diseases (both clonal and non clonal) associated with reasonable longevity not currently considered for allogeneic BMT because of prohibitive procedural mortality with conventional BMT (enrollment closed October 2010). In this protocol, eligible subjects are treated with an allogeneic PBSC transplant from an HLA identical or single HLA antigen mismatched family donor, using an intensive immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation in an attempt to decrease the transplant related toxicities while preserving the anti malignancy and,or anti host marrow effect of the graft. The low intensity non myeloablative conditioning regimen should provide adequate immunosuppression to allow stem cell and lymphocyte engraftment. T cell replete, donor derived, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF) mobilized PBSCs will be used to establish hematopoietic and lymphoid reconstitution. We will add back lymphocytes in recipients with less than 100% donor T cell chimerism in an attempt to prevent graft rejection and enhance a graft versus malignancy effect. The primary endpoint of this study is transplant related mortality (200 day survival). Other end points include engraftment, degree of donor host chimerism, incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), transplant related morbidity as well as disease free and overall survival.",Completed,All,2 Years,80 Years,"Graft vs. Host Disease, Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, Non Myeloablative Bone Marrow Transplantation, Engraftment, graft versus leukemia",200 days,Non Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,"Myeloproliferative Disorders, Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia","T cell replete PBPC allograft, Methotrexate, Cyclosporine, G CSF"

The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents given for the first 6 months after transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on these agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the most common GVHD prophylaxis used worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplants. This regimen demonstrates better control of acute GVHD, but is less effective against chronic GVHD. Management of chronic GVHD remains a challenge and it has become a significant health problem in transplant survivors with more frequent use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally, several issues arise with the standard approach including various toxicity symptoms and side effects, increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI, no prevention of other infectious diseases, and no prevention for disease relapse. This standard strategy of Tac,MTX will be used as a control in comparison to two other treatment plans both utilizing CNI free methods: CD34 selected T cell depletion in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts, and infusion of bone marrow (BM) grafts followed by post transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

NCT00001256,Steroids and Methotrexate to Treat Systemic Vasculitis,"This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prednisone and methotrexate in treating severe Wegeners granulomatosis and other systemic vasculitides. These diseases involve inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) that may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart and other sites. Current treatment with prednisone and the anti cancer drug cyclophosphamide is effective, but has significant side effects and a high rate of disease recurrence. In a small number of patients with vasculitis, prednisone and methotrexate, another anti cancer drug, have led to marked improvement, with fewer side effects than are seen with cyclophosphamide. This study will evaluate this drug combination in a larger patient population. Patients 10 to 80 years of age with active Wegeners granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg Strauss vasculitis, or microscopic polyangiitis overlap may be eligible for this 2 1,2 to 3 year study. In addition, patients with glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disease) and a positive blood test for C ANCA (antibodies found in certain vasculitic kidney diseases) or inflammatory sinusitis or lung nodule or infiltrates in the absence of infection may also be enrolled. Participants will take prednisone daily, by mouth, and low dose methotrexate weekly, by mouth or by injection either under the skin, into a muscle or into a vein. Patients who significantly improve with treatment will gradually reduce, and eventually stop, the prednisone. If the remission lasts, methotrexate will also be reduced and stopped after 2 1,2 years. If active disease recurs, the original treatment program may be started again. Patients who never achieve complete remission with treatment but whose symptoms are well controlled and experience no serious side effects may choose to either continue low dose methotrexate or stop therapy. Patients will be hospitalized 4 to 6 times a year, about 2 to 8 days each time, depending on their disease severity and response to illness. In addition, they will have the following tests and procedures: Medical history and physical examination (upon admission to the study and then every 1 to 3 months).. Blood tests for blood cell counts and for levels of enzymes that indicate liver damage (upon admission, then weekly, and finally, no less than monthly).. Additional blood tests to measure blood chemistries and evaluate kidney function (upon admission and again when clinically indicated).. Chest X rays (upon admission and when clinically indicated).. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (as needed).. Electrocardiogram (upon admission and then as clinically indicated).. Lung function studies (upon admission and at least every 6 months or as clinically indicated).. Ear, nose and throat evaluations (as clinically indicated).. Liver biopsy, if blood tests to monitor liver function are persistently abnormal. This procedure is done in the hospital under sedation to induce relaxation and drowsiness. The skin over the liver (upper right abdomen) is numbed with a local anesthetic and a needle is passed rapidly in and out of the liver to collect a small tissue sample for microscopic examination.","Previous studies at the NIH have demonstrated that in over 90% of cases of Wegeners granulomatosis (WG) and other systemic necrotizing vasculitides, glucocorticoid (GC) and daily low dose cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy has resulted in marked improvement and even remission. However, such therapy has been associated with about 50% relapses, 10% resistance to initial treatment and significant toxicity in almost all patients. Consequently, we have attempted to identify alternative therapies for the systemic vasculitides that would be less toxic then daily CP. An NIH study of the efficacy of intermittent high dose intravenous CP and daily GC (Protocol #88 I 56) revealed that 79% of 14 patients with WG either failed to respond to treatment, did not sustain improvement or could not tolerate continued treatment during a period of approximately two years. In another study (Protocol #89 I 18), we evaluated treatment with GC and weekly oral doses of methotrexate (MTX) in 15 patients with Takayasus arteritis, in whom disease previously failed to be controlled with GC, GC + CP, or in whom remission with such treatment was followed by relapse. Fifty three percent (8,15) of patients previously dependent on GC were able to achieve remission and discontinue GC therapy. Five of seven patients who remained on GC were in remission and receiving at least 50% less GC than prior to MTX therapy. Only three patients had progressive disease. The mean follow up period was 20 months. We have also recently analyzed our results for MTX + GC therapy and 29 patients with WG. Seventy six percent of patients had marked improvement and 69% achieved remission. Seventy two percent of those in remission have not required GC therapy for a mean period 10 months. We conclude that weekly low dose MTX therapy is a feasible alternative to CP in the treatment of systemic vasculitis. Judgement of the ultimate value of such therapy should be deferred until a greater number of patients have been studied over a longer period of time.",Completed,All,,,"Vasculitis, Cytotoxic Therapy, Inflammation, Glomerulonephritis, Inflammatory Sinusitis",,,,Treatment,"Inflammation, Vasculitis, Wegeners Granulomatosis",prednisone and methotrexate

Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate and bendamustine hydrochloride, before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells or abnormal cell and helps stop the patients immune system from rejecting the donors stem cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin and rituximab, may help the bodys immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patients bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cell from a donor can make an immune system response against the bodys normal cells.

NCT00870532,Study of Combination of Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine and Sorafenib in Patients With Advanced Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"Targeting the blood supply of cancer, called anti angiogenesis is a new but proven treatment strategy. There are two ways of achieving this effect. The first way to specifically target the molecular pathways that promote new blood vessel formation in cancer. An example of such an agent is sorafenib, which is an oral agent and which is already in use worldwide for the treatment of kidney and liver cancers. The second way is to target the cells lining the blood vessels by using low dose of chemotherapy agents administered at frequent intervals. This strategy is called metronomic chemotherapy. It is possible that combining agents like sorafenib and metronomic chemotherapy may further enhance anti cancer effects. This study aims to determine the optimal way of combining oral vinorelbine in metronomic doses and sorafenib. Oral vinorelbine is a chemotherapy agent that is already approved for use in cancer treatment such as lung cancer. By combining both oral anti cancer agents to optimize their anti angiogenic effects in this study, the potential benefit to the patients can be tremendous and far reaching. Special radiologic imagings and blood tests will be incorporated into this study to help further the understanding of the anti angiogenic processes of both agents.","Phase I Dose finding study: The patients will be divided into 3 cohorts (15 patients per cohort), each cohort receiving a fixed metronomic (thrice a week) dose of oral vinorelbine at 60 mg,week, 90 mg,week, and 120 mg,week respectively. Each patient within each cohort will receive a starting dose of sorafenib at 200 mg bid for 4 weeks. In the absence of dose limiting toxicities, the dose of sorafenib will be escalated to 400 mg bid for another 4 weeks, 600 mg bid for 4 weeks and then finally 800 mg bid. We should arrive at 3 different MTDs from the 3 cohorts. Once the MTD has been determined for each cohort, we will recruit an additional 12 patients for each cohort and study the PK profile of both drugs. The 12 patients in each cohort will be sequentially alternated to group 1 or group 2 treatment schedules. Group 1 (N=6 patients in each cohort) will receive vinorelbine three times per week starting on Monday (Day 1) followed by Wednesday (Day 3) and Friday (Day 5). In the subsequent weeks vinorelbine will be given on the same working days (i.e. Monday, Wednesday and Friday).

Current standard therapies include platinum containing drugs but at one year from diagnosis the survival rate is still low (30 40%) . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of a platinum free drug, named Vinorelbine, administered by the so called metronomic schedule in order to prolong the progression free survival of patients.","Systemic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Combination chemotherapy with a platinum based regimen has emerged as standard therapy for patients with advanced stage disease. Observations supported by the findings of several clinical trial, established the notion that an efficacy plateau had been reached in advanced stage NSCLC patients treated with platinum containing drugs. Recent phase III trials suggest the benefit of switch and continuing maintenance treatment with different drugs. As switched therapy, Vinorelbine has been selected on the base of its anti mitotic role. In fact, the use of anti mitotic drugs at lower dose but with higher frequency (metronomic schedule) seems to augment the anti angiogenetic effect of this kind of drugs, thus augmenting the efficacy of the therapy.

It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy is more effective than giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy followed by more chemotherapy in treating non small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy to see how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy followed by more chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III non small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.","OBJECTIVES: Primary Compare the overall survival of patients with stage III non small cell cancer treated with chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate (CV) followed by radical radiotherapy versus concurrent CV chemoradiotherapy followed by CV chemotherapy. Secondary Compare the progression free survival of patients treated with these regimens.. Compare the local progression free survival (local control).. Compare the hematological, pulmonary, esophageal, and neurological toxicities.. Compare the response.. Compare the quality of life.. Compare the cost effectiveness. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinically important factors. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I (sequential treatment): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 5 10 minutes on days 1 and 8.

NCT02555007,Metronomic Chemotherapy Based on Adaptative Bio mathematical Model of Oral Vinorelbine in Patients With NSCLC or MPM,"Background: Metronomic oral Vinorelbine has efficacy in metastatic NSCLC and malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, but all the studies published thus far were based upon a variety of empirical and possibly suboptimal schedules, with inconsistent results. Mathematical modeling showed by simulation that a new metronomic protocol could lead to a better safety and efficacy profile. Design: This phase Ia,Ib trial was designed to confirm safety (phase Ia) and evaluate efficacy (phase Ib) of a new metronomic oral vinorelbine schedule. Patient with metastatic NSCLC or malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, after failure of standard treatments, ECOG 0 2 and an adequate organ functions, will be eligible. Our mathematical PK PD model suggested an alternative weekly D1, D2 and D4 innovative schedule (named Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol) with a dynamic intake of 60, 30 and 60 mg, respectively. Trial recruitment is two staged as 12 patients are planned to participate in the phase Ia, to confirm safety and consolidate the calibration of the average parameters of the model. Depending the phase Ia result, and after favorable decision of a consultative committee, the extension phase (phase Ib) will be an efficacy study and will include a number of 20 patients receiving the Optimal Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol. The primary endpoint is the tolerance (assessed by CTC v4.0) for the phase Ia and the objective response according to RECIST 1.1 for the phase Ib. An ancillary study on circulating angiogenesis biomarkers will be a subproject of the trial.

NCT00312819,Initial Assessment of the Effect of the Addition of Disulfiram (Antabuse) to Standard Chemotherapy in Lung Cancer,"Recent studies in laboratory animals demonstrate the ability of disulfiram to significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of a mouse model of lung cancer. Work with cells in vitro support the idea that this inhibition is mainly due to the inhibition of angiogenesis  the formation of new blood vessels in the tumor. Furthermore, it was found out that the best effect has been obtained when disulfiram has been used not at the highest dose but at an optimal dose, which is smaller. Thus, this trial will assess the addition of disulfiram to chemotherapy in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLCA).","Metastatic non small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease with median survival times of several months. Any treatment which can prolong patients survival without causing severe side effects is of course an important addition to our limited arsenal in the fight against this disease. A recent article by Marikowsky and colleagues extended significantly our knowledge regarding the possible activity of disulfiram (well known in its commercial name Antabuse) as an anticancer agent (Marikowsky et al Int J of cancer 97 :34 2002). In this article it was demonstrated that disulfiram has potent antitumor activity and that it can act as a significant inhbitor of angiogenesis. Since disulfiram has been well tolerated by thousands of patients, and there are observations that anti angiogenic therapy enhances the effect of chemotherapy (for example bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in colon carcinoma) we decided to conduct a clinical trial assessing the effect of the addition of this drug at moderate doses to chemotherapy which is used as one of the standard therapies in lung cancer. In order to obtain information regarding the effect of the addition of this drug, only 50% of the patients will be treated with the drug and the rest will be treated with placebo.",Completed,Female,18 Years,,"Non small cel lung cancer, chemotherapy, randomized phaseII, disulfiram, antiangiogenesis, placebo",3 years,Randomized,Parallel Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"chemotherapy +, disulfiram"
NCT02139904,Vinorelbine in Mesothelioma,"This study is for patients with malignant mesothelioma of the lung lining (called pleura) who have had previous chemotherapy with a platinum based regimen whose disease has progressed. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, frequently drug resistant, and incurable disease that is increasing in incidence in the UK and worldwide. All patients with MPM will relapse following first line chemotherapy and at present, there is no standard treatment available for patients in the second line setting. The vinca alkaloid chemotherapy drug vinorelbine has shown promising activity in a single arm UK trial. However to date, there has been no randomised evaluation of vinorelbine in mesothelioma in the second line setting. In addition, there have been no trials which have looked at underlying molecular changes in mesothelioma which may predict vinorelbine efficacy; This might allow vinorelbine to be used in patients only where there is a chance of benefit. Studies suggest that vinorelbine requires a gene called BRCA1 (shown to be absent in 38% of mesothelioma cases) in order to induce cell death in mesothelioma. The VIM trial aims to establish whether vinorelbine in patients with MPM helps them live longer and whether the BRCA1 gene is helpful in selecting patients most likely to benefit from treatment. Patients will be randomised (1:2) to receive either active symptom control (ASC) (which is all supportive care deemed necessary for pain management excluding disease modifying treatment) or ASC with vinorelbine. Patients will continue vinorelbine treatment until evidence of disease progression (or unacceptable toxicity to the drug or patient withdrawal).

NCT00256815,Combination of Weekly Chest Radiotherapy and Oral Navelbine for the Palliation of Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase I Study,"The study is designed for subjects whose cancer is too advanced and therefore cannot be operated with the goal of completely removing the cancer. At this stage of the disease, most subjects cannot be cured from the disease, however, treatment can help subjects to live longer and better by keeping the cancer under control. All treatment offered to is primarily pursuing that goal. Subjects at this stage of their disease traditionally receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy, both treatments in succession or both concurrently. Recently, the administration of both methods of treatment concurrently has been employed and indicate somewhat better results. Specifically, a class of chemotherapy agents called Vinca Alakaloids used in combination with radiation therapy appear promising as determined in small studies. The drug Navelbine is part of this class of drugs. This drug is approved as an infusion through the veins. The pill form is under development and will be used in this form in this treatment program. For this protocol, radiation will be administered using a schedule which is more convenient for patients, by once weekly chest irradiation for a total of 12 weeks. Use of this schedule was determined to be as good as the more commonly used daily radiotherapy. The once weekly schedule is less cumbersome as it involves less visits. The rationale and reason why you are being asked to participate in this program is to study whether the drug Navelbine can be given together with the once weekly radiation schedule. Radiation will be administered in two fractions, 6 hours apart on one day. For this program, the drug Navelbine would be made available as a pill, and would not have to be infused through the vein. The proposed protocol will use increasing doses of the drug Navelbine in pill form to find the highest dose of Navelbine that is tolerated in conjunction with radiation therapy. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of Navelbine, which is higher than the dose of the previous subject. This escalation will continue until the highest tolerated dose has been determined. The administration via pill would be easier and avoid previously experienced side effects that were experienced by infusion into the veins of subjects, such as burning and sores at the infusion site.","35 patients with advanced NSCLC will be enrolled (stages III and IV) and treated once per week in two fractions for a total of 12 cycles using a previous prescription developed by Salazar et al to a total of 6000 rad.

NCT00001944,Vinorelbine and XR9576 to Treat Cancer,"Tumor resistance to anti cancer drugs is a major problem in cancer treatment. Studies have found that a protein (P glycoprotein) on some cancer cells pumps chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing treatment effectiveness. In laboratory tests, an experimental drug called XR9576, has blocked pumping by this protein. It is being used in this study to try to increase the amount of the anti cancer drug vinorelbine, in cancer cells. Vinorelbine has been shown in several clinical trials to be effective against some advanced cancers, including breast, lung and ovarian, and is one of the drugs pumped out of tumor cells by P glycoprotein. Patients with cancer 18 years and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with tests that may include blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, CT scans, X rays, and nuclear medicine studies. A tumor biopsy may be done for diagnostic or research purposes. Study participants will undergo tumor imaging with the radioactive drug Tc 99m Sestamibi. This drug accumulates in tumor cells and is eliminated from them in much the same way that some cancer drugs are eliminated from cells. The drug is injected into a vein and a series of pictures are taken with a gamma camera. After this baseline scan, patients will receive a dose of XR9576 and undergo a second scan 24 hours later. The scan will show whether XR9576 affects the accumulation and elimination of Sestamibi in tumor cells. This procedure may provide a way to monitor cancers for evidence of chemotherapy resistance and show if XR9576 can improve the effectiveness of therapy. At least 10 days after the baseline and XR9576 scans, patients will begin the first of 3 or more 21 day cycles of vinorelbine treatment. On days 1 and 8 of each cycle, patients will receive a 30 minute infusion of XR9576 intravenously (through a vein) followed by vinorelbine, infused over a 6 to 10 minute period. (In some patients, XR9576 will be administered before only one of the two vinorelbine dosages.) Physical examination, blood tests, and other procedures may be done periodically to monitor treatment.","Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance remain major obstacles in the treatment of cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that in some malignancies P glycoprotein can confer resistance, and that its reversal can improve therapeutic outcome. Clinical trials investigating P glycoprotein antagonists have been hampered by the occurrence of unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions, which have required dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic agents to avert excessive toxicity. XR9576 is a new P glycoprotein antagonist that is more potent, has prolonged activity, and is potentially devoid of significant pharmacokinetic interactions.

NCT00002823,Combination Chemotherapy Compared With No Treatment Following Surgery in Treating Patients With Non small Cell Lung Cancer,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy given after surgery is more effective than surgery alone for non small cell lung cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy following surgery with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA non small cell lung cancer.","OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the impact on overall survival of adjuvant cisplatin and either a vinca alkaloid or etoposide (with or without radiotherapy) vs. no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage I,II,III non small cell lung cancer. II. Assess the frequency of treatment related deaths and severe toxic effects. III. Describe the patterns of failure, second malignancies, and toxic effects associated with each treatment regimen. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating institution, type of prior surgery, and pathologic stage. Each participating center will determine which combination chemotherapy regimen and which of three cisplatin doses will be given to all patients treated at that center. The treatment group receives cisplatin combined with either vindesine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, or etoposide every 3 4 weeks for 3 4 courses, depending on the dose of cisplatin. The second group receives no adjuvant chemotherapy. Treating institutions determine prior to entering the trial which patients receive adjuvant radiotherapy: none; those with node positive disease; those with N1 disease only; those with N2 disease only; or those eligible for a randomized radiotherapy trial. For patients in the treatment group, radiotherapy begins 3 4 weeks after the last course. Patients are followed at 6 months, then annually.

NCT01441752,Efficacy Study of Integrated TCM Combined With Chemotherapy in Postoperative NSCLC Patients,"The investigators performed a multi center, randomized, controlled, double blind, prospective study on evaluating effect of chemotherapy combined with or without integrated TCM on quality of life (QOL) of postoperative Non small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. The investigators plan to involve 600 cases for observation in 3 years (300 cases for each group), expecting that QOL of postoperative NSCLC patients can be improved by integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy compared to that by chemotherapy alone.","At present the high rate of recurrence and metastasis of postoperative non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is one of the leading causes resulting in failure of treating lung cancer. More than 35% of postoperative lung cancer patients with stage I died in 5 years due to recurrence or metastasis; the 5 year survival rates of stage II, IIIa, IIIb were 31%, 17.9% and 11.7% respectively. The survival rate was improved by 5% with adjuvant chemotherapy after resection, so regimen consist of platinum based two chemical medicines are commended as the adjuvant chemotherapy for treating postoperative NSCLC patients, but the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy can decrease quality of life (QOL) of patients. Literature and our preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival and improve QOL, but high level evidences are needed. The investigators perform a randomized, double blind study in NSCLC patients after complete resection with stage I III. Patients are randomized over observational group (TCM granules plus chemotherapy), and control group (TCM placebo plus chemotherapy). The investigators will observe 4 treatment periods, after that the observational group will be treated for another 4 months with integrated TCM combined with western medicine treatment (oral TCM medicines plus TCM intravenous injections), and there is no intervene measures in control group. Regular follow up will be arranged. The primary efficacy assessments are: QOL (QLQ C30 scales); Secondary efficacy assessments are: (1) 2 year disease free survival rate; (2) disease free survival; other efficacy assessments are: (1) TCM symptoms changes; (2) tumor markers (CEA, CA 125 and CYFRA21 1) and so on. Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be assessed at the same time. The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with Western medicine treatment has a better efficacy on improving QOL of patients, prolonging disease free survival time than that of chemotherapy treatment.

NCT03325816,Nivolumab and 177Lu DOTA0 Tyr3 Octreotate for Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer,"This research study is being done to assess the safety and tolerability of study drugs, 177Lu DOTA0 Tyr3 Octreotate (Lutathera) and nivolumab in subjects with small cell lung cancer or advanced or inoperable neuroendocrine tumor of the lung that has overexpressed somatostatin receptors (SSRT). Lutathera is an investigational radioactive agent that targets tumor cells that express SSRT. Nivolumab is an investigational agent that targets and inhibits a pathway that prevents your immune system from effectively fighting your cancer. The combination of these 2 study drugs is investigational. The term Investigational in this context means that the drugs have not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Giving Lutathera and nivolumab together may increase the effectiveness of this therapy. We first need to find out the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given safely together with nivolumab. This study will be the first study to test giving Lutathera together with nivolumab. Once we have found the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is. The purposes of this study are: To find the highest doses of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab without causing severe side effects. To find out the side effects seen by giving Lutathera at different dose levels with nivolumab. To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called PD L1 makes you more likely to have a response to the combination of Lutathera and nivolumab.","The purpose of this project to see if the combination of 177Lu DOTA0 Tyr3 Octreotate and nivolumab is safe and tolerable, and provides PFS benefit compared to observation alone in the maintenance setting in patients with ES SCLC and no disease progression after first line platinum based chemotherapy. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. A standard dose escalation phase I design will be used. Three subjects will be enrolled at each dose level in the absence of DLT. Selection of the starting dose of 177Lu DOTA0 Tyr3 Octreotate and nivolumab is based on the results from previous clinical studies with each compound used as single agent and the fact that the combination has not been tested in clinical trials.

NCT02434081,"NIvolumab COmbination With Standard First line Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Stage IIIA,B Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma",The aim of the study is to investigate the tolerability (how severe the side effects are) and the efficacy (how well the treatment works) when nivolumab is added to the current standard treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) given to patients with advanced NSCLC.,"Over the past decade, concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy has become the first choice treatment for most patients with stage III non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, only about 30% of patients are alive 5 years after con¬comitant therapy. These figures remain approximately the same with the addition of surgery. After chemo radiotherapy, at least 30 40% of the patients show local tumour progression on CT scans as first site of relapse. Also after surgery, about 30% of patients fail locally as a first site of recurrence. In addition, more than half of the patients eventually develop distant metastases that may have been present but undetected at the time of staging or that may have come from persistent or recurring local disease. It is thus obvious that new approaches that preferentially tackle both local and distant disease sites are needed to improve long term survival and cure rates. Attempts to improve the long term survival include radiotherapy dose escalation,acceleration, new chemotherapy combinations, and adding biological agents and cancer vaccines to standard regimens. At present, none of these have demonstrated an improved outcome. Improved understanding of the immune profile of NSCLC has led to immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules responsible for abrogating an anti cancer immune response such as PD 1 and CTLA 4. Nivolumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody that inhibits the immune checkpoint receptor PD 1 expressed on activated T cells, has demonstrated positive results in several trials in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. However, rare cases of severe or fatal pneumonitis have been reported throughout clinical trials using anti PD1 or anti PDL1 compounds. Pre clinical data consistently show a clear beneficial effect by combining local radiotherapy and anti PD 1. Not only was the local tumour control increased, but an abscopal effect on distant metastases could be observed. Radiotherapy clearly acted as an in situ tumour vaccination resulting in the induction of specific anti tumour immunity in all sites of the body that could result in a clinical anti tumour effect because of the combination with anti PD 1. In these models, the concurrent administration of anti PD 1,PD L1 antibodies was more efficient to provoke an anti tumour immune response than the sequential approach. While the role of immunotherapy is currently being evaluated as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors in all lines of treatment of advanced NSCLC, as monotherapy in early NSCLC adjuvant setting as well as monotherapy in consolidation after completion of definitive chemo radiotherapy, it has not yet been assessed in combination with radiotherapy. Anecdotal data of concurrent treatment in the palliative setting suggest acceptable safety and a good tolerability of such combination. The NICOLAS trial was initially developed to prospectively assess the safety of checkpoint inhibition concurrently with chemo radiotherapy. In summary, there is a definite unmet need in multi disciplinary care to improve the prognosis of patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC, with a strong rationale supporting the combination of chemo radiotherapy with anti PD 1. A major theoretical concern is the development of pneumonitis, a rare toxicity of both radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. The main aim of the ongoing current trial is therefore to evaluate the pneumonitis rate in patients being treated with chemo radiotherapy in combination with nivolumab treatment. Rationale for protocol amendment 2: Since the NICOLAS trial was initiated, the landscape of combining chemo radiotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibition, such as anti PD 1 antibodies, has changed rapidly, opening a new window of opportunity. There is a very strong interest of the multidisciplinary lung cancer community to investigate the optimal integration of anti PD 1 treatment into chemo radiotherapy. Currently, 11 sites from 5 countries are activated for the NICOLAS trial and recruiting strongly (ahead of schedule). Using this momentum will allow us to rapidly recruit additional patients in order to reach the power to not only determine the feasibility in terms of pneumonitis grade 2 and abouve, but also to evaluate the efficacy of the concurrent treatment. So far, during the regular safety review, the ETOP IDMC did not observe any additional toxicity compared the chemo radiotherapy alone. A first planned analysis of the PACIFIC trial (stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by the anti PD L1 durvalumab or observation, NCT02125461) showed an increased progression free survival (PFS), which was co primary endpoint together with overall survival (OS). The full details are not known, yet, but it appears that the pre clinical rationales of combined chemo radiotherapy and anti PD 1 treatment can be successfully transferred into clinical trials, without serious toxicities. A recent secondary analysis of the Keynote 001 trial indicates synergistic affects of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This international, multicentre phase I trial assessed the effect of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with progressive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients were assigned to multiple expansion cohorts to allow for the inclusion of patients who were naïve to systemic therapy and those who had progression after one or two previous regimens. The results from this study showed that the effect of pembrolizumab was significantly higher in patients who received previous radiotherapy than in patients without previous radiotherapy. These findings were well in line with pre clinical studies that underlined the ability of radiotherapy to enhance antitumour immune response. In the absence of of serious pulmonary toxicity, the apperant benefit of chemo radiotherapy and anti PD 1 and the high interest of the NICOLAS study group, we propose to amend the NICOLAS trial protocol to expand on the number of patients in order to reach sufficient power for an efficacy readout (progression free survival).",Completed,All,18 Years,,"NSCLC, IIIA,B",Time from enrolment until 6 months post radiotherapy,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III,Nivolumab
NCT03262779,Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Anti PD 1 axis Therapy resistant Advanced Non small Cell Lung Cancer.,The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab after primary or acquired resistance to anti programmed death 1 (PD 1) axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor regression.,"Approximately 20 percent of unselected patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and progression during or after standard first line chemotherapy will experience tumor response to nivolumab. Treatment options for patients who are not responsive to programmed death 1 (PD 1) axis inhibitor therapy are limited, and the mechanisms of primary resistance are poorly understood. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on superiority to either agent alone5. The results of a phase I study evaluating combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC (NCT01454102) were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3 mg,kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg,kg every 6 weeks yielded an objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 of 39%, with one year survival rate of 69% and grade 3 4 treatment related adverse event rate of 33%. These results prompted an ongoing phase III study comparing this regimen to standard first line chemotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy with chemotherapy and nivolumab for patients with advanced NSCLC (NCT02477826). The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab after primary resistance to anti PD 1 axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor regression. It is hypothesized that ipilimumab will enable more effective immune priming in some patients, resulting in the trafficking of tumor specific cytotoxic T cells to the tumor, as well as depletion of tumor permissive T regulatory cells. With concurrent nivolumab, PD 1 inhibition in the tumor will enable effective anti tumor attack by tumor specific T cells. Serial tumor biopsies and blood collections will allow interrogation of changes in the tumor microenvironment (and periphery) that support this hypothesis. The investigators will primarily enroll patients who have experienced progression of NSCLC after anti PD 1 axis therapy without initial response to such therapy (primary resistance). A smaller cohort of patients with acquired resistance to anti PD 1 axis therapy (i.e. progression after initial response) will additionally be accrued. The study record was updated to add individual arms for those with primary resistance and acquired resistance. The intent of the study is not to compare these treatment arms.",Completed,All,18 Years,,,"Tumor response assessment will occur every 9 weeks after initiating trial therapy for the first 24 weeks, and thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression or up to 4 years.",Non Randomized,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,"Carcinoma, Non Small Cell Lung",combination nivolumab and ipilimumab

NCT03486119,A Study for Identification of Predictive Immune Biomarker in Peripheral Blood for Nivolumab Therapy in NSCLC Patients,The study aimed to elucidate predictive immune related biomarker to the responsiveness to the PD 1 blockade and evaluate the dynamics of immune cells in peripheral blood from NSCLC patients during nivolumab treatment. Hypothesis that The ratio of MDSC after 1st or 2nd cycle can predict the response to nivolumab in NSCLC patients earlier than the tumor assessment by imaging scan. The primary objective is to determine whether myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) ratio after 1st or 2nd cycle of nivolumab can be accurate predictive biomarkers of nivolumab in advanced NSCLC.,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising treatment modality in NSCLC. More recently, Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD 1) inhibitor was approved by FDA as ≥ second line treatment, which are major paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment. Subsequently two randomized phase III trials, comparing the overall survival (OS) of nivolumab with that of docetaxel as second line therapy, were completed. CheckMate 017 included squamous cell lung cancer patients and CheckMate 057 did non squamous cell lung cancer patients. In both trials, nivolumab showed improvement of OS in all comers regardless of PD L1 expression. As a result of retrospective analysis, PD L1 positivity was not predictive factor for the efficacy in squamous cell histology, but predictive factor for non squamous histology. Finally, nivolumab was approved the all comer NSCLC patients regardless of PD L1 expression after failure to platinum based chemotherapy. Although tumor PD L1 expression is currently the best predictive biomarker for PD 1 blockades, the prediction accuracy is not high enough to solidify the drug efficacy. Actually, PD L1 negative patients can still respond to PD 1 blockades and some of PD L1 positive patients do not respond to these therapy. Interestingly, the responders among PD L1 negative patients showed comparable duration of response in those with PD L1 positive in Checkmate 057 trial. Therefore, we need to select patients who are most likely to benefit from anti PD 1 therapy and identify the better biomarker to predict the response to PD 1 blockades in NSCLC patients earlier than tumor assessment by imaging scan. To maximize the benefit of nivolumab in NSCLC patients, nivolumab should apply to all comers, but we need to early decide to go or stop depending on predictive biomarker after 1st or 2nd cycle. It is well known that various immune suppressive mechanisms including an accumulation and activation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exist in tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. MDSC are one of the major components of the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating their potentials, such as tumor progression by promoting tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion of healthy tissue by tumor cells, and metastases. Recent studies show that MDSC as a heterogenous group of myeloid progenitors with immuno suppressive function could be used as one of the promising biomarker candidate for cancer immunotherapies. Ipilimumab could affect the immune cells in peripheral blood from melanoma patients. This study demonstrated that responder to ipilimumab showed early increase of eosinophil counts, whereas non responders presented that elevated monocytic MDSC increased serum levels of S100A8,A9 and HMGB1 that attract and activate MDSCs. This result suggests that measurement of MDSCs could be a predictive immune related biomarker to ipilimumab treatment. On the other hand, we do not know how PD 1 blockade affects the immune suppressive cells such as MDSC or Tregs and makes difference between responder and non responder. Recently, we conducted pilot trial to compare the T lymphocytes and MDSC population in peripheral blood between responder and non responder to nivolumab. Interestingly, our preliminary data demonstrated that after 1st cycle of the therapy CD11b+CD33+MDSC,CD45+ or CD14 ratio has significantly decreased in responder compared to non responder. The cut off value of peripheral MDSC ratio could be reliable biomarker for accurate prediction of nivolumab therapy in NSCLC patients.

Their disease has come back or has not gone away after treatment. The experimental treatment plan consists of an antibody therapy called Nivolumab that helps the subjects\ T cells control the tumor, and special immune system cells called EBV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, also a new therapy whose side effects are well studied. Some patients with NHL or LPD are infected with the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis (called Epstein Barr virus, or EBV) before or at the time of their diagnosis. The cancer cells that are infected by EBV are able to hide from the body\s immune system and escape destruction. Investigators want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill cells infected by EBV can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Investigators have used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow or solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma with good success. These cells are called EBV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBVSTs), and are effective in treating these diseases. These EBVSTs are experimental and not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sometimes it is not possible to grow these cells; or they may not last very long in the body after being given into the vein thereby having only limited time to fight the tumor. With this study, investigators aim to increase the duration of time that the T cells can last in the body and can effectively fight the cancer by using nivolumab. Nivolumab is FDA approved for treatment of other kinds of cancer like lung cancer and a skin cancer called Melanoma. The purpose of this study is to find out if EBVST cells in combination with nivolumab are safe, to learn what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy may help patients with EBV related lymphoma or LPD.","The investigators will draw blood from the subject to make EBV specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBVSTs) in the lab. Investigators will make the cells by first growing a special type of cells called dendritic cells (DCs) or monocytes to stimulate the T cells. Then they will add specially produced mixtures of proteins that included the LMP, EBNA1, and BARF proteins. These are used to stimulate T cells. As the T cells grow, investigators add some of the subjects cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them. They also add a cell called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the immune system to encourage the T cells to grow. This stimulation trains the EBVSTs to kill cells with EBV proteins on their surface. These cells will be grown and frozen. The cells grown in the lab will be thawed and injected into the subjects vein over 2 10 minutes. Initially, one dose of the drug nivolumab is given one day before the EBVST cells are infused (on day 0) and then every 2 weeks for a total of four doses of nivolumab.

However, the costs of those new treatments are extremely high. Osimertinib is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and partially by CYP3A5. Combination of osimertinib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in a smaller first pass effect and a decreased clearance of osimertinib, thereby increasing the exposure to osimertinib. Cobicistat is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, this mechanism may be used to boost osimertinib, as is done for other drugs, mainly drugs used to treat HIV infected patients. Using this personalized treatment approach and combining the concepts of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacokinetic boosting, osimertinib therapy could become much more cost effective. By reducing the necessary dose of osimertinib, this strategy may ultimately result in a significant reduction in drug costs, as the additional expenditure for the CYP3A4 inhibitor and blood sample analysis are negligible compared to the price of osimertinib.",Completed,All,18 Years,,"Osimertinib, Cobicistat, Pharmacokinetic boosting",Three weeks,,Single Group Assignment,Treatment,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,Cobicistat

NCT04546282,Resistance to Oral Therapy in Lung Cancer,"In the management of non small cell lung cancer of the adenocarcinoma type, different therapeutic strategies can be proposed. These strategies are defined according to the results of a biological analysis of blood and,or tissue samples from the lung tumor. Mutations in the tumor DNA are sought. Thus, patients with sensitizing mutations can benefit from a treatment with a 3rd generation tyroine kinase inhibitor (TKI) whose efficacy has been widely demonstrated. Patients without tumor mutations will not benefit. However, resistance to TKIs appears after a certain time, often linked to the appearance of new mutations in the tumor. For this reason, blood biologic analyses are regularly performed to search for the emergence of resistance mutations and to propose a therapeutic alternative as soon as possible. These analyses are performed routinely in the laboratory.

EGFR is a type of protein found on the surface of cells in the body. When this protein is mutated and becomes too active, it can lead to cancer growth. T790M is a mutation that develops in response to treatment of the EGFR mutation. Participating patients will have tumor tissue (via cobas test), as well as 2 plasma samples (via cobas and Guardant360 tests) and 1 urine sample (via Trovera test), tested for EGFR T790M mutation status. If the results of the cobas tissue and,or plasma test show that a patient is T790M positive, they will be treated according to standard of care, which may include treatment with osimertinib. Osimertinib is approved for use in the United States for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutation positive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","RADIANCE is an open label, prospective biomarker study to assess analytic concordance between non invasive testing (plasma and urine) and tissue testing for the EGFR T790M mutation. All patients will have tumor tissue (via cobas test) as well as 2 plasma samples (via cobas and Guardant360) and 1 urine sample (via Trovera) tested for the EGFR T790M mutation (Part 1). Patients who are confirmed T790M negative based on both cobas biomarker tests (tissue and plasma) will have completed the study. Patients who demonstrate T790M+ on cobas tissue and,or cobas plasma testing may choose to undergo treatment with osimertinib in consultation with their healthcare provider (no investigational product will be provided for this study) and will continue to Part 2. In case of insufficient samples for biomarker testing or invalid results from any of the 4 testing modalities, another sample may be acquired from the patient, if feasible, including the patients decision to undergo a second biopsy. Failure of a patient to undergo a tissue, plasma, or urine sample collection for biomarker testing will result in their withdrawal from the study. If 1 or more samples are insufficient for testing or 1 or more of the test results are invalid, the patient may still qualify for the clinical outcomes part of the study (Part 2) as long as cobas tissue and,or cobas plasma test is T790M+ and the patient receives at least one dose of osimertinib. During Part 2 Follow Up Visits will occur according to standard of care, but at least every 12 weeks for the first 12 months of treatment. A Final Study Visit will occur at 18 months (Week 72 +, 14 days) or upon early withdrawal. Statistical methods Sample size: The sample size is such to provide enough statistical precision for the primary endpoint. A sample size of 400 patients with evaluable biomarker test results for analytic concordance has been selected in order to achieve a precision of no more than ±5% around the estimated concordance rate. If a 15% inflation factor is applied (~70 patients) to this sample size to take into account those patients who may not be evaluable for concordance estimates, a total of approximately 470 patients will be enrolled. The Full Analysis Sets will include the following: Part 1: All patients in the study with cobas tissue, Guardant360 plasma, and Trovera urine test results. Part 2: Patients who demonstrate T790M+ cobas tissue and,or cobas plasma testing and were treated with at least 1 dose of osimertinib (i.e., all patients in Part 2).

NCT02529995,"Phase I, Study in Chinese NSCLC Patients","A Phase I, Open Label, Two Parts Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability,Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti tumour Activity of AZD9291 in Chinese Patients with Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer who have Progressed Following Prior Therapy with an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Agent Study Objective: 1, Primary Objective To characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9291 and its metabolites (AZ5104 and AZ7550) after single then multiple doses of AZD9291 administered orally once daily in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR TKI) agent. 2, Secondary objective(s) To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD9291 when given orally to Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR TKI agent. To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti tumour activity of AZD9291 by evaluation of tumour response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.","This is a phase I, open label, two parts (Part A and Part B) study to determine the pharmacokinetics of AZD9291 administered orally at two dose levels (40 mg and 80 mg) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR TKI agent (+, additional chemotherapy regimens). Approximately 24 patients will enter into this study, with 12 patients at each dose level. Cohort 1 will investigate the pharmacokinetics of single then multiple dosing of AZD9291 at 40 mg once daily dose.. Cohort 2 will investigate the pharmacokinetics of single then multiple dosing of AZD9291 at 80 mg once daily dose. The enrollment of Cohort 2 will start after Cohort 1 finishes the enrollment. The first 12 patients enrolled in the study will be in 40 mg dose Cohort. Patients will be administered a single dose of AZD9291 on Day 1, Cycle 0 at the beginning of Part A period. From Day 2 to Day 6, no treatment will be given, but PK samples will be obtained; on Day 7 (Cycle1, Day1), the patients will be administered AZD9291 once daily on a continuous schedule, ie, no break in AZD9291 dosing. Part A will complete after Cycle 4 treatment and Part B will start without treatment interruption. Patients in both cohorts should continue on treatment with AZD9291 until a treatment discontinuation criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as patients may continue to receive AZD9291 beyond RECIST 1.1 defined progression as long as they are continuing to receive clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator. The whole study will be divided nominally into two parts: Part A will assess the pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy and safety of AZD9291 at 40 mg and 80 mg respectively, and Part B will assess only the safety and efficacy data of AZD9291. Following completion of the Part A, patients will automatically continue to Part B.",Completed,All,18 Years,130 Years,,"PK blood samples are collected at pre dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 120 hours post dose.
